== Software hosted on or related to freedesktop.org ==

Some software has made its way here to live. None of this is "endorsed" by anyone or implied to be standard software, remember that freedesktop.org is a collaboration forum, so anyone is encouraged to host stuff here if it's on-topic.

You can view the source code in our repository using [http://cvs.freedesktop.org ViewCVS].

Some of these modules keep track of their bugs in the local [http://bugs.freedesktop.org bugzilla].

	* [:/Avahi:Avahi] is a multicast dns library
	* [http://cairographics.org cairo] is a vector graphics library with cross-device output support.

	* [:/shared-mime-info:shared-mime-info] is a package containing a large number of common MIME types, created by converting the existing KDE and GNOME databases to the new format and merging them together, and software for updating the database based on the share-mime-info specification.
	* [:/startup-notification:startup-notification] is a sample implementation of startup notification (telling the desktop environment when an app is done starting up).
	* [:/STSF:Standard Type Services Framework] - platform independent text imaging and font handling framework
