== Software hosted on or related to freedesktop.org ==
Some software has made its way here to live. None of this is "endorsed" by anyone or implied to be standard software, remember that freedesktop.org is a collaboration forum, so anyone is encouraged to host stuff here if it's on-topic.

You can view the source code in our git repository using [[http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/|gitweb]] and the source code in our CVS repository using [[http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/|ViewVC]] (which includes old copies of the source code for projects that have migrated to git).  For more about these repositories, see UsingGit and UsingCvs.
