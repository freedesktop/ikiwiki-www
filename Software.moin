== Software hosted on or related to freedesktop.org ==

Some software has made its way here to live. None of this is "endorsed" by anyone or implied to be standard software, remember that freedesktop.org is a collaboration forum, so anyone is encouraged to host stuff here if it's on-topic.

You can view the source code in our repository using [http://cvs.freedesktop.org ViewCVS].
