== What is GNOME? ==

The [http://www.gnome.org GNOME Desktop] is an attractive and useful desktop environment created by the GNU project. GNOME is both free (under the ["GPL"]) and is one of the most widely used desktop environments on the GNU/Linux operating system. The current release of GNOME is 2.12; however 2.8 is available under Debian ["stable"]/["sarge"], while 2.10 is available under testing/["etch"].

= Installing GNOME =

If you have not ["X"] installed on your box, to get a bare minimum base install of X, do using ["aptitude"] or ["apt-get"]:
{{{
 # aptitude install x-window-system-core
}}}


The current ["metapackage"] for installing a good set of GNOME tools in [http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable sid], [http://www.debian.org/releases/testing etch] and  [http://www.debian.org/releases/stable sarge] ["Debian"] is `gnome`.  

== Standard ==
So, from the ["command line"], run
{{{
 # aptitude install gnome
}}}

This will install additional software (gnome-office, evolution) that you may or may not want.

== Custom ==

For a smaller set of ["app"]s, you can also do
{{{
 # aptitude install gnome-desktop-environment
}}}

A set of additional productivity apps will be installed by
{{{
 # aptitude install gnome-fifth-toe
}}}

== Developers ==

If you need development packages, e.g. for compiling GNOME dependent packages from source, you should try
{{{
 # aptitude install gnome-core-devel
}}}

For a full set of developer tools, please do
{{{
 # aptitude install gnome-devel
}}}
== Tasksel ==
You can use ["tasksel"] to install GNOME or other DesktopEnvironment.
== Configuration ==

Most configuration of the GNOME desktop is done via its various ["GUI"] utilities. The location of these varies depending on version, but common utilities include networking, themes, sounds and much more. It is also possible to configure (read/write) settings using the command line with ["gconftool"](["2"]).
