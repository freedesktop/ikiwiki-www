[[!img Architecture plan] 

using OCS -> rest, easy to replicate  

different clients connect to different servers 

server under the control of distribution  

how to share ? 

if we use a central server, who will maintain ? 

Garett :  applications distributers should not have their own server -> a way to have 3rd party to plug in the system 

content identifier on the server  

* desktopfilename 
* version of soft 
* repository ( distro, repo for each distribution ) -> url to metadata  
* distro/version  
no need to filter on server, as the client only show applications that exist  

how to play well with 3rd party ? ( OBS, livna ) -> just add another server  

need to solve these 2 problem : 

* discover applications 
* discover repositories 
Frank proposal ( for solving discover repositories ) : 

* add a shared linux ecosystem repositories  
* several client connecting to their server, and also to the shared one
