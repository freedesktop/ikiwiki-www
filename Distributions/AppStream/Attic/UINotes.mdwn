Issue: How do you find the application you're looking for? 

What do we need: title, icon, screenshot, comments, ratings, description. 

Access rights (privileges needed for the app to run)? There's no technical solution for now anyway, so ignore it. 

Categories for apps: 

* use the ones from .desktop files? 
* should we have same categorization in app menu and app store? => probably different 
* tree structure doesn't scale 
* [[http://www.appbrain.com/|http://www.appbrain.com/]] 
* [[http://instantwatcher.com|http://instantwatcher.com]] 
* amazon 
      * good thing here is the tags that are proposed after a search: they're used to split results in equal groups (and not all tags are proposed) 
      * no huge list of results, but pages of results 
* tags: a defined set of common tags. No free-form. 
find apps per mime-types 

One-level of navigation. We don't want to have deep navigation. => toplevel categories. And then, inside of this, you can filter it down: keywords. There's no real way to display all tags in a reasonable to the user anyway. 

default order of apps should make sense: top 5 apps should be the 5 apps people want. 

Native app vs website? 

* website enables easy sharing with other people 
Use software center as a basis 

* finding an app is not good at the moment 
* once you're on the page of one app, it's quite okay (not perfect) 
How to find apps: 

* front-page: 
      * first level of categories (5-10) 
      * featured apps 
* second level: 
      * something at the top (featured/recommend apps) 
      * then, below, list of results 
      * display a small set of tags (most-used in the list of results) to help user filter? 
* search interface should not really be different from browse interface 
* the way people find apps has to be "web-like" 
we need a web version of the app to have it indexed by google (people look on google) is there a good reason we need a native version of the app? 

Conclusion: 

* no tree view 
* get results immediately 
* 1 or 2 steps only 
* keywords 
* filtering on the result page 
* indexed by google, a link to share the app 
* web page and native client need to work together/interop 
* we can use debian tags 
* packages enhancing package X should be displayed on the page of package X (like Software Center does). Useful for plugins, addons. 
* top results are important. We want recommendations there (popular apps, related to what user has already installed, etc.) 
* add "Launch" button to app pages 
* maybe just get rid of "install button", and merge with "Launch" (ie, automatically install if needed) 
web site: should be shared between distros? Or per distro? 

Main question: use Ubuntu Software Center + build a web site OR just build web site 

share code between web interface & native interface to avoid too much duplication of efforts 

keep in mind tablets. Also possibly make use of multitouch where it makes sense.
