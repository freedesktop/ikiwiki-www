# AppStream Software & Library

Utilities to generate, maintain and access the [[AppStream|Distributions/AppStream]] Xapian database. 


## What is AppStream-Core?

AppStream-Core makes it easy to access application information from the AppStream database over a nice GObject-based interface.
It uses a PackageKit plugin to automatically (re)generate the AppStream Xapian database of applications.
The libappstream library can be used by a wide variety of programming languages (via GObject-Introspection). In combination with [[PackageKit|http://packagekit.org]] in can be used to build Software Centers. 

The AppStream utilities are **beta software** at time, and the API might change a lot during the development process. Please keep that in mind when using it!
