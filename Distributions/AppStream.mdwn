## AppStream-Core

AppStream-Core provides basic tools to build an AppStream database. It also provides libappstream, a library which makes it easy to write Software-Center-like applications by providing access to the AppStream metadata. See more on [[the project page|Distributions/AppStream/ASCore]]. 


## Documents that were edited on pad

Please note that most of those documents lack context for people who didn't attend the meeting. It's our intention to properly document the results, and the current notes are, at the moment, kept here mostly as reference for the meeting attendees.
