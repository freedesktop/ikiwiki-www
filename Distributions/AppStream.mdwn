## What is AppStream?

AppStream is a cross-distribution effort for enhancing the way we interact with the software repositories provided by (Linux) distributions by standardizing software component metadata.

It provides the foundation to build software-center applications, by providing metadata necessary for an application-centric view on package repositories.
AppStream additionally provides specifications for things like an unified software metadata database, screenshot services and various other things needed to create user-friendly application-centers for (Linux) distributions.

## Specification

You can find the latest version of the AppStream specification at [[freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/|http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/]].

The specification describes the *AppStream upstream XML* format which is used by upstream software authors to describe the software component (application, firmware, font, ...) they provide, as well as the *AppStream distro XML* format that is used by distributions to ship the metadata in bundled and processed form to their users.

The specification now also contains a description of DEP-11, which is a YAML-based version of the *distro XML* specification used by Debian and its derivatives.

## Get involved

* General discussion is happening on the [[distribution mailing list|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/distributions]] at Freedesktop 
* AppStream Spec & Library development: [[github.com/ximion/appstream|https://github.com/ximion/appstream]]

## Get it!

You can download the latest release of the AppStream library and tools at [[freedesktop.org/software/appstream/releases/|http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/releases/]]
Development is happening at Github: [[appstream|https://github.com/ximion/appstream]]

There is also a separate project called [[appstream-glib|https://github.com/hughsie/appstream-glib]], implementing the AppStream specification as well, which is used primarily at GNOME. It provides a distro-metadata generator, which distributions can use to provide their distro-XML file.
