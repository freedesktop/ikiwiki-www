This page used to contain information about how to modify legacy freedesktop.org SSH accounts. Since these accounts are mostly not used any more, the content has been removed. If you need to modify an existing SSH account, please file a [new issue on freedesktop/freedesktop](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/issues/new) and an admin will help you.
