## These are not really standards

Note: freedesktop.org is not a standards body. 


#### Draft specifications that have pretty good de facto adoption/agreement:

                     * [[DnD|http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xdnd/]] is the drag-and-drop specification shared between [[GTK+|GTK+]] and [[Qt|Qt]]. A [[local copy|Specifications/XDND]] of the spec resides on the wiki. [[Work on revisions|Specifications/XDNDRevision]] are in progress. 
                     * [[Window manager specification|Specifications/wm-spec]] standardizes extensions to the ICCCM between X desktops; we are also working to merge these extensions into the ICCCM itself as appropriate. 
                     * The [[XEmbed|Specifications/xembed-spec]] proposed specification for inter-application embedding of controls. 
                     * [[X clipboard explanation|Specifications/clipboards-spec]] is not a formal specification, but explains our consensus on how the X clipboard works. Qt and GTK+ both follow this document. 
                     * [[UTF8_STRING|http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRING]] selection format for interchange of UTF-8 data. 
                     * [[The XML Bookmark Exchange Language|http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/]], or XBEL, is an Internet "bookmarks" interchange format. 
                     * [[Desktop Entry specification|Specifications/desktop-entry-spec]] describing information about an application such as the name, icon, and description. These files are used for application launchers and for creating menus of applications that can be launched. 
                     * [[Menu specification|Specifications/menu-spec]] specifies how menus are built up from desktop entries. 
                     * [[Desktop base directory spec|Specifications/basedir-spec]] details how desktops should locate files at runtime. 
                     * The [[Icon Theme specification|Specifications/icon-theme-spec]] proposed specification for a common way to store icon themes. 
                     * [[Free Media Player Specifications|Specifications/free-media-player-specs]] deal with standard ways to store and read metadata across players and media formats.

#### Proposed X extensions:

                     * [[X Fixes Extension|Software/FixesExt]] is a draft specification for changes in how the device independent parts of the X server works. 
                     * [[X Damage Extension|Software/XDamage]] is a draft specification for an extension to allow applications to track modified areas within a window or pixmap. 
                     * [[X Composite Extension|Software/CompositeExt]] is a draft specification for an extension that moves sub-trees of the window hierarchy to off-screen memory, permitting access to and manipulation of those bits, including constructing the parent window contents programmatically rather than automatically. 
                     * [[X Event Interception Extension|Software/XEvIE]] is a draft specification for an extension to allow a client program to intercept all input events. ([[link|http://www.freedesktop.org/~ajax/xevie/xevie.html]]) 
The above four extensions are deployed as of Xorg 6.8.  Damage and Fixes are enabled by default, while Composite and XEvIE must be enabled by the user at runtime.
