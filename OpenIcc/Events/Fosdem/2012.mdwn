## Talks


### Kai-Uwe Behrmann: Colour Management in Compositors

      * type: ca. 45 minutes full length presentation and discussion (will run in the Xorg time frame) 
Xorg allows compositors to run on efficient GPU hardware. It is possibly to deploy GPUs for low power consumption colour correction of the whole desktop. The talk will introduce in the topic by the [[CompICC|http://www.oyranos.org/compicc/]] colour server implementation and give a overview about used techniques and concepts. It will try to outline next generation desktop colour management and what is needed, from my point of view, to get colour management well supported in graphics servers and deployed by toolkits and applications.

### Chris Lilley: Color Management in SVG2

      * type: ca. 45 minutes full length presentation and discussion 
      * abstract: SVG 1.1 is now widely implemented, and has some (minimal, optional) support for ICC colours. In the main though it is an sRGB system. SVG2 adds a conformance class for full ICC support (v2 and v4) including named colours, direct specification in LAB or LCHab, and interpolation in LAB or LCHab. Unmanaged device-specific colour is also supported. 
      * bio: Chris Lilley is Technical Director for the Interaction Domain at W3C. He is involved in SVG, CSS, and Web Fonts.
