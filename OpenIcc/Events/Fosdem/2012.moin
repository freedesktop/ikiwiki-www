== Call for Papers ==
We would be glad to see talks proposed related to colour management. If you think you could contribute a talk about your favorite project and user topic or get a interesting discussion rolling, then please get in contact with Kai-Uwe.

'''Submission deadline is new year 2011/2012. We will middle January confirm accepted talks.'''

While OpenICC is usually much biased towards ICC ;-), we feel obliged by the first part of our title and like to get in contact with people using other colour management standards as well and discuss all the overlapping topics. That could be movie or photography. LetÂ´s make it happen. FOSDEM is told to be a good place for that.

== Proposed Talks ==
=== Kai-Uwe Behrmann: Colour Management in Compositors ===
   * type: ca. 45 minutes full length presentation and discussion (will run in the Xorg time frame)
Xorg allows compositors to run on efficient GPU hardware. It is possibly to deploy GPUs for low power consumption colour correction of the whole desktop. The talk will introduce in the topic by the [[http://www.oyranos.org/compicc/|CompICC]] colour server implementation and give a overview about used techniques and concepts. It will try to outline next generation desktop colour management and what is needed, from my point of view, to get colour management well supported in graphics servers and deployed by toolkits and applications.
