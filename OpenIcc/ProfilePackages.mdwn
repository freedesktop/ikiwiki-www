[[SWOP and GRACoL Profiles|http://files.idealliance.org/color_characterization/icc_profiles/swop2006%20and%20gracol2006%20icc%20profiles.zip]] SWOP and GRACoL are specifications for standardized printing in the US maintained by [[IDEAlliance|http://www.ideallinace.org]]. Profiles for printing according SWOP and GRACoL are based on characterization-data hosted from [[CGATS|http://www.npes.org/standards/tools.html]] Profiles are calculated with Profiling Tools from [[X-Rite|http://www.xrite.com]]. Integration of the profiles into installers is may possible but needs the allowance from IDEAlliance.
