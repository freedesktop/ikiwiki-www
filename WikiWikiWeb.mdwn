The [[!c2 FrontPage desc="first ever wiki site"]] was founded in 1994 as an automated supplement to the [[!c2 PortlandPatternRepository desc="PortlandPatternRepository"]]. The site was immediately popular within the pattern community, largely due to the newness of the internet and a good slate of [[!c2 InvitedAuthors desc="InvitedAuthors"]]. The site was, and remains, dedicated to [[!c2 PeopleProjectsAndPatterns desc="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns"]].  

[[!c2 WardCunningham desc="WardCunningham"]] created the site and the WikiWikiWeb machinery that operates it. He chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for quick and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web. An early page, [[!c2 WikiWikiHyperCard desc="WikiWikiHyperCard"]], traces wiki ideas back to a [[!c2 HyperCard desc="HyperCard"]] stack he wrote in the late 80's.
