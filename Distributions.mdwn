# Distributions Wiki

This is a collaboration space for distributions to share ideas and discuss common issues. 


## Communicating

Email: [[Mailing List|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/distributions]] 

IRC: irc.freenode.net ##distros 


## Contents

Right now, there's only a little content in this wiki. So we can link it all to the front page. As we generate more content, we'll have to organize things better. 

* [[ConflictingFiles|Distributions/ConflictingFiles]] is a page to coordinate distribution renames of files upstream provides. These renames are caused because the file exists in more than one package at a time. Coordinating these renames reduces end-user confusion by making the renames the same across distributions where possible. 
* [[ContactingPackagers|Distributions/ContactingPackagers]] documents ways to contact specific packagers in other distributions. 
* [[WhyUpstream|Distributions/Packaging/WhyUpstream]] documents why we should encourage all our packagers to upstream their changes. 
* [[DistributionLocations|Distributions/DistributionLocations]] where to find BTSs, VCSs, patches amongst other things. 
* [[Meetings|Distributions/Meetings]] lists cross-distro meetings, and links to their conclusions. 

## Projects

* [[AppStream|Distributions/AppStream]]: cross-distro umbrella project for a great user experience when finding and installing applications
