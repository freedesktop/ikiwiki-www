== Welcome to freedesktop.org. ==

freedesktop.org is a free software project to work on interoperability and shared technology for desktop environments for the X Window System. The most famous X desktops are [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] and [http://www.kde.org KDE] but any developers working on Linux/UNIX GUI technology are welcome to participate. 

freedesktop.org wants to build a base platform for desktop software on Linux and UNIX. The elements of this platform become the backend for higher-level application-visible APIs, such as Qt, GTK+, XUL, VCL, WINE, GNOME, and KDE. The platform contains both code and specifications.

freedesktop.org is not currently a formal standards organization, though some see a need for one that covers some of the areas we are working on. 
For Linux operating system standards, please see the [http://www.linuxbase.org Linux Standard Base] project. freedesktop.org is loosely affiliated with the [http://www.freestandards.org Free Standards Group]; the FSG is one group that does "de jure" standards for free software. [http://www.x.org The X.Org Foundation] and the [http://www.ietf.org IETF] are other groups that do formal standards.

Unlike these groups, freedesktop.org is just a "collaboration zone" where ideas and code can be tossed around, and de facto specifications encouraged. We also host any "on-topic" software projects, if you have a project that fits into our mission and needs hosting please let us know on [mailto:xdg-list@freedesktop.org our mailing list]. [http://lists.freedesktop.org/ Mailing lists] on the software and discussions are hosted here as well.

If you have any comments or questions about this site please send a message to the list, or just create a [wiki:UserPreferences account].  Editing pages is restricted to registered users.
