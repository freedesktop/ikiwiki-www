= Welcome to freedesktop.org =

freedesktop.org is open source / open discussion software projects
working on interoperability and shared technology for X Window System desktops.
The most famous [wiki:Desktops X desktops] are [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] and
[http://www.kde.org KDE], but developers working on any Linux/UNIX GUI
technology are welcome to participate.

freedesktop.org is building a base platform for desktop software on Linux
and UNIX.  The elements of this platform have become the backend for
higher-level application-visible APIs such as Qt, GTK+, XUL, VCL, WINE,
GNOME, and KDE.  The base platform is both [wiki:Software software] and [wiki:Standards standards].

== News ==

CVS has moved. Use cvs.freedesktop.org for SSH access and anoncvs.freedesktop.org for pserver access. anoncvs is sync'd from cvs every 15 minutes.

== Software ==

freedesktop.org hosts any "on-topic" software projects.  If you have a project that
fits into our mission and needs hosting, please make a request using our [http://bugs.freedesktop.org bugzilla].
Mailing lists about freedesktop software are hosted
[http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo here].

== Standards ==

freedesktop.org is not a formal standards organization, though some see a
need for one that covers some of the areas we are working on.  For Linux
operating system standards, look at the [http://www.linuxbase.org Linux Standard Base]
project.  [http://www.x.org The X.Org Foundation] and the [http://www.ietf.org IETF]
are other groups that do formal standards.
The [http://www.freestandards.org Free Standards Group] is one group
that publishes "de jure" standards for free software -- freedesktop.org
is loosely affiliated the FSG.

Unlike a standards organization, freedesktop.org is a "collaboration zone"
where ideas and code are tossed around, and de facto specifications are
encouraged.  The primary entrÃ©e to these discussions is the
[http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg xdg mailing list].

== Getting Involved ==

You can get involved in a number of ways.  See the MissionStatement for
our principle activities.  See GettingInvolved for concrete suggestions
on how you can contribute. See AccountRequests for information on how to
obtain CVS access to a project.
