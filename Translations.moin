There is currently no central place where various freedesktop.org packages can be translated. You should browse [[Software|package pages]] to look for indications about how to contribute translations for each project.

However, you will be able to translate some freedesktop.org packages in the following infrastructures:

 * Translation Project (http://translationproject.org):
   gstreamer, xdg-user-dirs, XKeyboardConfig, unicode-han-translation, unicode-translation

 * Transifex.net (http://www.transifex.net):
   fprintd, shared-mime-infos, cups-pk-helper<<BR>>
   Note that to participate to these package translations, you have to be a member of a team in the [[http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/freedesktop/|freedesktop.org Transifex project]].
