["User interface"]
----
Ncurses is a programming library providing an ["API"], allowing the programmer to write text-based user interfaces, ["TUI"]s, in a terminal-independent manner. It also optimizes screen changes, in order to reduce the ["latency"] experienced when using remote Unix shell.

Ncurses stands for "new curses", and is a replacement for the discontinued 4.["4BSD"] classic http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/curses.

Ncurses is a part of the ["GNU"] project. It is one of the few GNU files not distributed under the GNU General Public License or GNU Lesser General Public License; it is distributed under a license like the X11 License, which is sometimes referred to as the MIT License.
