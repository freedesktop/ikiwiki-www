There is currently no central place where various freedesktop.org packages can be translated. You should browse [[package pages|Software]] to look for indications about how to contribute translations for each project. 

However, you will be able to translate some freedesktop.org packages in the following infrastructures: 

* Translation Project ([[http://translationproject.org|http://translationproject.org]]): 
      * gstreamer, xdg-user-dirs, XKeyboardConfig, unicode-han-translation, unicode-translation 
* Transifex.net ([[http://www.transifex.net|http://www.transifex.net]]): 
      * fprintd, shared-mime-infos, cups-pk-helper  
 Note that to participate to these package translations, you have to be a member of a team in the [[freedesktop.org Transifex project|http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/freedesktop/]].
