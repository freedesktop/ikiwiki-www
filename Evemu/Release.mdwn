# Steps done to make a release of evemu

This is only required for the maintainers, but I am putting these here to have a memo of them.

* sudo make distcheck (release will run as a plain user and will fail)
* bump configure.ac with the version number
* commit "Evemu vX.Y.Z"
* push the commit to upstream
* run /xorg/util/modular/release.sh --dry-run --dist .
* triple check if everything went smoothly
* run /xorg/util/modular/release.sh --dist .
* edit evemu-X.Y.Z.announce
* send evemu-X.Y.Z.announce to input-tools@lists.freedesktop.org (sign it while sending)
