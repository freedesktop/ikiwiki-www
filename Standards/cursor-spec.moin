This is a draft specification for a cursor naming and usage standard.

---++Mailinglist
Discussion of this specification should occur on [[Main.GettingInvolved][xdg-list]].

---++Cursor list
<table>

<tr><td valign="top"> ''X-cursor'' <td>
The X window system logo.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''default'' <td>
Default cursor. Indicates the interface is idle and prepared to accept commands from
the user. Used to manipulate basic user interface elements like buttons and scrollbars.
Usually a left pointing diagonal arrow.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''right-arrow'' <td>
Inverted version of the default cursor. This cursor is used in Motif when a popup menu
or a drop down combo-box is open, to indicate that the widget has grabbed the mouse.
Typically rendered as a right pointing diagonal arrow.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''up-arrow'' <td>
Up pointing arrow cursor. This cursor is typically used to identify an insertion point.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''text'' <td>
Text input cursor. Indicates that the cursor is in a region in which horizontal text
can be selected and possibly edited. Typically rendered as a vertical I-beam.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''vertical-text'' <td>
Text input cursor. Indicates that the cursor is in a region in which vertical text
can be selected and possibly edited. Typically rendered as a horizontal I-beam.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''pointer'' <td>
Indicates that the object below the cursor is clickable. This cursor is typically
used for links in web browsers. It shouldn't be abused for pushbuttons and other
UI elements where it's otherwise apparent by the design of the widget that it's
a clickable object. Often rendered as a pointing hand.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''crosshair'' <td>
Crosshair cursor. Typically used for precision drawing or manipulation of an area.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''help'' <td>
Help cursor. Indicates that the system is in a context help mode, and if the user
clicks an object a small window will open up to provide usage information for that
object. The context help mode is typically activated by clicking a help button on
the titlebar of a window that provides context help. Often rendered as the default
cursor with a question mark symbol next to it.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''progress'' <td>
Default cursor + busy cursor.  Indicates a pending activity which may asynchronously
affect the interface but which is not blocking commands from the user.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''wait'' <td>
Busy cursor.  Indicates that the interface is not prepared to accept commands
from the user and is blocked on some external resource. Often rendered as a
watch or an hourglass.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''copy'' <td>
!DnD copy cursor. Indicates that a copy of the dragged object will be created in
the area below the cursor if dropped. Typically rendered as the default cursor
with a small plus sign next to it.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''alias'' <td>
!DnD link cursor. Indicates that a link to the original location of the dragged
object will be created in the area below the cursor if dropped. Typically rendered
as the default cursor with a small curved arrow next to it.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''no-drop'' <td>
!DnD no-drop cursor. Indicates that the dragged object can't be dropped in the
region below the cursor. Typically rendered as the default cursor with a small
circle with a diagonal line through it. Can be identical to not-allowed.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''not-allowed'' <td>
Forbidden cursor. Indicates that a particular region is invalid for the current
operation. Often rendered as circle with a diagonal line through it.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''cell'' <td>
The thick plus sign cursor that's typically used in spread-sheet applications
to select cells.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''all-scroll'' <td>
Scroll/move cursor. Used to indicate that moving the mouse will also move the UI
element below the cursor. Often rendered as a combined vertical and horizontal
twin-headed arrow.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''context-menu'' <td>
Indicates that a context menu is available for the object underneath the cursor.
Typically rendered as the default cursor with a small menu-like graphic next to it.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''row-resize'' <td>
Horizontal splitter bar cursor. Indicates that the bar below the cursor can be
moved up and down to resize the objects it separates. Used when it's not apparent
if the object below the cursor is just a visual separator between two other UI
elements, or an object that can be manipulated. Usually rendered as a vertical
twin-headed arrow, split in the middle by a horizontal line.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''col-resize'' <td>
Vertical splitter bar cursor. Indicates that the bar below the cursor can be
moved left and right to resize the objects it separates. Used when it's not
apparent if the object below the cursor is just a visual separator between two
other UI elements, or an object that can be manipulated. Usually rendered as a
horizonal twin-headed arrow, split in the middle by a vertical line.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''e-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the right edge of a window, and that the edge
can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window horizontally.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''ne-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the top-right edge of a window, and that
the edge can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window diagonally.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''nw-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the top-left edge of a window, and that
the edge can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window diagonally.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''n-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the top edge of a window, and that the
edge can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window vertically.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''se-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the bottom-right edge of a window, and that
the edge can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window diagonally.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''sw-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the bottom-left edge of a window, and that
the edge can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window diagonally.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''s-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the bottom edge of a window, and that the edge
can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window vertically.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''w-resize'' <td>
Indicates that the cursor is over the left edge of a window, and that the edge
can be clicked and dragged in order to resize the window horizontally.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''ew-resize'' <td>
Horizontal resizing cursor. Indicates that cursor is over the the left or right
edge of a window, and that ithe edge can be clicked and dragged to resize the
window horizontally. Typically rendered as a horizontal twin-headed arrow.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''ns-resize'' <td>
Vertical resizing cursor. Indicates that cursor is over the the top or bottom
edge of a window, and that the edge can be clicked and dragged to resize the
window vertically. Typically rendered as a verticaly twin-headed arrow.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''nesw-resize'' <td>
Back-diagonal resizing cursor. Indicates that the UI element below the cursor is
the top-right or bottom-left corner of a window, and that it can be clicked and
dragged to resize the window diagonally. Typically a twin-headed arrow.

<tr><td valign="top"> ''nwse-resize'' <td>
