== Recent File Storage Specification ==

Many applications choose to have a menu containing a list of recently used files, which can be used as an alternative to opening a file selector. GNOME, and KDE applications have done this for quite some time, and probably others have as well. This specification aims to do the following things:
	* Provide a standard mechanism for storing a list of recently used files (really, URIs)
	* Allow for notification of changes in the list
