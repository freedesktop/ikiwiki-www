The freedesktop.org [:Standards/shared-mime-info-spec: Shared MIME database] provides a single way to store static information about MIME types and rules for determining a type.

In addition to this, two further pieces of information are often needed:

	* Which applications can open a file (''Mozilla can view files of type text/html'').
	* Which application should open a file by default (''Bob wishes to view text/html files in Mozilla by default'').

== Status ==

This specification is in the requirements-gathering / early-planning stages.

== Recording that an application can handle a particular type ==

The list of applications which can open files of a particular type is static information and should be stored in the MIME database, using some extension elements. The
[:Standards/AddingMIMETutor: Adding to the MIME database tutorial] provides a sample of how this might look. The extension element associates MIME entries with application '''.desktop''' files (eg, '''gimp.desktop'''). Issues to address:

	* Must provide a way to find a command to execute to view/edit/etc a file.
	* There should be support for multiple actions (view, edit, print, etc).
	* There must be some kind of priority system (Vim can view HTML, but should not be the default if a web browser is installed).
	* Internationalised descriptions of applications should not be repeated (Gimp should not have to specify translations of "Edit in Gimp" for every MIME type it supports).

== Setting the default application ==

Because this is configuration information, it should not go in the MIME database. Instead, it should be set using the
[:Standards/config-spec: Shared Configuration System]]. This specification should define a set of key names to be used for this.
