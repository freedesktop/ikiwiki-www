## Software hosted on or related to freedesktop.org

The following is an incomplete list of some of the software projects that are, or were, hosted on freedesktop.org.

You can go to [[our GitLab instance|https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/]] to view and download the code, file bugs, and contribute code through merge requests.

freedesktop.org does not itself run these projects day to day: we provide hosting and infrastructure for the communities which themselves run the projects.

All projects hosted by us are available under open-source licenses under equitable terms to all parties. These projects do not require Contributor License Agreements which assign more rights to one party than another. They may require an assertion like the [[Developer's Certificate of Origin|https://developercertificate.org]] which is simply a more formal document to state that you are leally permitted to contribute under the project's license; you do not, however, need to assign anyone rights that you do not yourself receive to others' contributions.
