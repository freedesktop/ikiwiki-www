## Software hosted on or related to freedesktop.org

Some software has made its way here to live. None of this is "endorsed" by anyone or implied to be standard software, remember that freedesktop.org is a collaboration forum, so anyone is encouraged to host stuff here if it's on-topic. 

You can view the source code in our git repository using [[cgit|http://cgit.freedesktop.org/]].  For more about these repositories, see [[UsingGit|UsingGit]].
