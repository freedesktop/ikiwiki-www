Names of pages have to [[LookLikeThis|LookLikeThis]]. It's called a [[WikiName|WikiName]]. If you write a word that [[LookLikeThis|LookLikeThis]], it will be automatically turned into a link. More details about this you find on [[HelpForBeginners|HelpForBeginners]].

To experiment with wiki markup, go to the [[WikiSandBox|WikiSandBox]] and then click on "Edit****Text" at the bottom of the page. Use your browser's "open a new window with this link" feature on the word "[[WikiSandBox|WikiSandBox]]", so you can keep the help pages open side-by-side to the editing window.
