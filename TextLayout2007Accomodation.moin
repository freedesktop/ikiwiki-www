== Text Layout Summit at aKademy 2007 - Accomodation ==

Here are a few accomodation options for aKademy in Glasgow.  See the [http://akademy.kde.org/ aKademy] web pages for additional information.

=== CHEAP ===

 * [http://www.euro-hostels.co.uk/ Glasgow Euro Youth Hostel] apx. Â£16.95/night - [http://www.kde.org.uk/akademy/registration.php Register] for aKademy before
   Monday April 30, 2007 to book accomodation here before it fills up.

=== MODERATE ===

 * [http://www.premiertravelinn.com/pti/home.do Glasgow Travel Inn] at George Square: 
   
    * Â£59/night single adult
    * Â£62/night two adults

According to the aKademy web page, this is closest to the Strathclyde
University venue where aKademy is taking place this year.

=== HIGH END ===

 * [http://www.thistlehotels.com/thistle/hotels/home.do Thistle Hotel Glasgow]: Apx. Â£80 per night single or two adults

This hotel is about a kilometer from Strathclyde.  We've previously stayed at
Thistle properties in London and they were really good.  This one in Glasgow
looks to be in a modern building and the reviews for it are quite mixed.  It's
listed as a 4-star property.
