# Code Of Conduct Process Recommendations

Here are some recommended responses to violations in the freedesktop.org CodeOfConduct. These are processes which have worked in the past and which serve as useful suggestions for future cases.

## Content visible through freedesktop.org planet aggregator

The RSS feed aggregator planet.freedesktop.org re-posts articles from community member web sites. As it is hosted on freedesktop.org infrastructure and carries the freedesktop.org logo, any content visible through that is subject to the freedesktop.org Code of Conduct.

 1. Remove link to site containing offending content
 2. Verify that site is no longer included in feed
 3. Notify community member of violation
 4. When feed presented to the aggregation software is in compliance, re-add link to the site.
