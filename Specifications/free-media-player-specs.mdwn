## Free Media Player Specifications

These specifications are designed to provide standard and complete ways to perform common tasks with media (especially music) metadata that may otherwise be very difficult. They aim to be as simple as possible while still being robust and useful, and to be consistent across metadata formats. 


### Mailinglist

Discussion of this specification should occur on the [[xdg mailing list|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg]].
