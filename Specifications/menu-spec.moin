The [[http://portland.freedesktop.org/wiki/XdgUtils|xdg-utils]] package is a useful implementation of this
specification.  It provides simple interfaces to create menu entries or desktop icons on a Free Desktop.
xdg-utils should save a typical application developer considerable time and heartburn.
