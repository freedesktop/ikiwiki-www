== Overview ==
Since popularity of Linux operating system in industrial environment increase, needs for interoperability between application and field equipment come true. The main goal of DBPC is to define robust and reliable standards set of objects, interfaces and methods for use in process control and manufacturing automation applications to facilitate interoperability.

 DBus:: Formally, D-Bus is an inter-process communication mechanism. Simply, DBus is a software data bus which permits communication between applications. Unless it is not a process field bus as used in factory floor, its core functionality can easily be apprehended in the same way by control engineer. For more detail about DBus please read [[Software/dbus|related specification]].
 DBPC:: DBPC is a layer above DBUS which define a standard set of objects, interfaces and methods for use in process control and manufacturing automation applications to facilitate interoperability. Primary goal is defining a common communication language for real time communication of plant data between control devices from different manufacturers and SCADA, HMI, process control and open source applications.
 DBPC-server:: DBPC servers are service who provide common items access trough DBus. Generally a DBPC server grants real time data access to one or more remote programmable logic controller. Typically DBus servers represent a field bus protocol. (For example : ModbusTCP DBPC server, Profibus DBPC server).
 DBPC-client:: DBPC client are application who access to one or more remote programmable logic controller via DBus.
