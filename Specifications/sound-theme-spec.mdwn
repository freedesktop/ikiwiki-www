# Sound Theme and Naming Specifications

<http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications> 


## About

A sound theme is a set of sounds, sharing similarities / instruments... The user can then select the sound theme that they want to use, and all applications will use sounds from the theme. This definition is similar to icon theme. 

These two specs are heavily based on the [["Icon Theme Specification"|Specifications/icon-theme-spec]], the [["Icon Naming Specification"|Specifications/icon-naming-spec]] and the [["Bango Project"|Bango]]. Comments are welcome!
