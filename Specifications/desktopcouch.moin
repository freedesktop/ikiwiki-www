=== Purpose ===
Integration of [[http://couchdb.apache.org|CouchDB]] storage into desktop applications, for automatic replication and synchronization of data between computers.

=== Examples ===
 * Store notes, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, etc on a central storage
 * Replicate and synchronize that data from users' desktops to several machines
 * Provide servers with the ability to provide a web interface to display and manage that data from a browser everywhere (like [[http://ubuntuone.com|Ubuntu One]] or [[http://www.midgard-project.org/|Midgard]])

=== Software ===
Applications implementing the CouchDB replication protocol:
 * [[http://couchdb.apache.org|CouchDB]]
 * [[http://www.midgard-project.org/|Midgard]]

Development tools:
 * [[https://launchpad.net/couchdb-glib|couchdb-glib]] is a GLib-based API implementing the [[http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_REST_API|CouchDB REST API]] plus some top-level utilities to make things easier for developers. With bindings for other languages
  * [[http://live.gnome.org/Vala/ExternalBindings|Vala]]
 * [[https://launchpad.net/desktopcouch|desktopcouch.records]] is a Python API to allow Python applications to connect to a Desktop CouchDB. The desktopcouch project which it is part of manages all the infrastructure described in this specification.

=== Formats ===
Being this a vendor independent solution, anyone can set up a [[http://couchdb.apache.org|CouchDB]] instance on their server and allow others to replicate/synchronize their data there. but for this to work correctly, we need standard formats for every specific record type that is going to be stored in the database. The following links get you to pages describing that format for the following record types:
 * [[Specifications/desktopcouch/note|Notes]]: used by [[http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/|Tomboy]]
 * [[Specifications/desktopcouch/bookmark|Bookmarks]]: used by [[http://launchpad.net/bindwood|Bindwood]] for Firefox
 * [[Specifications/desktopcouch/contact|Contacts]]: used by [[http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/|Evolution]], Akonadi
 *
 * [[Specifications/desktopcouch/replication|Internal Replication]]: used by desktopcouch itself to maintain replication peerage.

=== Reserved database names ===

 * management
 * users

=== Documentation ===
There should be a proper documentation homepage to organise this stuff properly. -- sil
 * [[http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2009/09/03/desktop-couch-irc-talk|Summary of desktopcouch]] - an IRC lecture given as part of Ubuntu Developer Week, which summarises desktopcouch and its goals and some usage tips. Useful for: everyone
 * [[Specifications/desktopcouch/Documentation/SimpleGuide|Simple guide to using desktopcouch]]: some code snippets and general commentary on how to use desktopcouch from your application. Useful for developers using desktopcouch in their application, people hacking on desktopcouch.records or couchdb-glib, people porting desktopcouch to other systems. Not useful for users running applications that use desktopcouch.
 * [[Specifications/desktopcouch/Documentation/How_Desktopcouch_Works|How desktopcouch works]]: describing how the underlying desktopcouch services fit together. Useful for system administrators, people hacking on desktopcouch itself, people looking to port desktopcouch to other systems. Not useful for developers using desktopcouch in their applications, users running applications that use desktopcouch.
