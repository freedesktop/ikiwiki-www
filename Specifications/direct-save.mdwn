### Overview

The Direct Save Protocol (XDS) builds on top of the [[XDND|Specifications/XDND]] protocol to allow users to save a file by simply dragging it to a file manager window, thereby avoiding the necessity of having a directory browser in each application's Save File dialog. 


### Mailinglist

Discussion of this specification should occur on [[xdg|http://www.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg]]. 


### Current status

The specification is now stable and not expected to change in incompatible ways. The last change was in 1999. All the ROX applications and those using the JX framework have supported XDS since 1999.
