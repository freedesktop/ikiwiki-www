## File URI Specification

This document specifies how URIs for normal UNIX filenames (file: URIs) are  interpreted and created. Its vital that all desktops/application use file URIs  in the same way, or applications will be unable to interchange files when using things like drag and drop or passing filenames as URI arguments (as used in  desktop files).
