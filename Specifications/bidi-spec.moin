== Bidirectional Scripts in Desktop Software ==
Bidirectional scripts are those with characters flowing from right to left.  Major bidirectional scripts are the Arabic, Persian and Hebrew scripts, but there are other ones too.  Supporting these languages in the user interface of a desktop system needs special support in several layers of the system.  Experiments and history shows such special support moves on the very thin edge between completely unusable and highly usable.  So they deserve their own guidelines for a consistent cross-desktop behavior.  That's what we aim to do here.
