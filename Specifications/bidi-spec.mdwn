## Bidirectional Scripts in Desktop Software

Bidirectional scripts are those with characters flowing from right to left.  Major bidirectional scripts are the Arabic, Persian and Hebrew scripts, but there are other ones too.  Supporting these languages in the user interface of a desktop system needs special support in several layers of the system.  Experiments and history shows such special support moves on the very thin edge between completely unusable and highly usable.  So they deserve their own guidelines for a consistent cross-desktop behavior.  That's what we aim to do here. 


### Readings (a.k.a. References)

* [[Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/]] (UBA from now on, a.k.a UAX#9) is the place to start.  It contains the basic algorithm to map a Unicode plain text string to a visual ordering. 
* [[Bidirectional Layouts in GTK+|http://behdad.org/download/Presentations/bidi-layouts/]] is a presentation of the state of art bidi support in Gtk+ by mid 2004.  Discusses several problems and concepts that are general to all GUI applications. 
* [[Hierarchically Implicit Bidi|http://cben-hacks.sourceforge.net/bidi/hibidi.html]] is a personal proposal for a hierarchical bidi system. 
* [[Guidelines of a Logical User Interface for Editing Bidirectional Text|http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/Hebrew/logicUI24.htm]] (also [[here|http://www-306.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/bidiui/index.jsp]]) is the guidelines in use by IBM. 
* [[Yudit Bidirectional Information|http://yudit.org/bidi/]] discusses surprises and potential security problems with bidi text support complying to the UBA.

* [[Mozilla Bi-Di API proposal|http://www.langbox.com/AraMosaic/mozilla/BiDi_API.html]] (out-dated) is the old proposal to add support for bidirectional text to Mozilla.  Note that the API proposed in this document is missing essential features, like line breaking support. 
* [[The 'direction' and 'unicode-bidi' properties|http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#direction]] in CSS 2.1 specification, and its [[box model|http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#q11]].

Unfortunately seems like the whole thing did not make it into final CSS 3.  [[Mozilla|https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74880]] bug about the issue, and [[KDE|http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56219]]'s.

### Non-Readings (a.k.a. Pre-Unicode Tries)

* [[Understanding bidirectional language support|http://www-306.ibm.com/software/webservers/hostondemand/library/v8infocenter/hod/en/help/bidi.html]] is an older IBM standard. 
* ECMA TR53 Handling of Bi-directional Texts, Second Edition is a technical report on supporting bidi text in text terminals.  No one knows if it was ever implemented.
