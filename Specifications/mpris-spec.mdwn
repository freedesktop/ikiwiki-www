# Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification

The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification (MPRIS) is a standard D-Bus interface which aims to provide a common programmatic API for controlling media players. 

It provides a mechanism for discovery, querying and basic playback control of compliant media players, as well as a tracklist interface which is used to add context to the active media item. 


## View the specification

The specification can be [[viewed online|http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/]].  The latest version is [[2.2|http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/]]. 

All versions with the same major number (eg: 2.x) are backwards compatible. 

Version 1 of the specification is [[fatally flawed|http://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/mpris/2010-June/000084.html]] and should not be used. 


## Specification source

The specification is maintained as [[D-Bus|Software/dbus]] introspection XML annotated with [[Telepathy extensions|http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/DbusSpec]].  It can be found in a [[git repository|http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg/mpris-spec]] along with tooling to build the HTML version of the specification.

Discussion happens at [[mpris@lists.freedesktop.org|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/mpris]]. 

[[Archives from 2011 and earlier|http://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/mpris/]] can be found on the VideoLAN site. 


## Testing

In order to check that your media player conforms to the specification, one of the developers of MPRIS has created a compliance-testing tool.  It can be [[found on GitHub|http://github.com/randomguy3/mpristester/]].
