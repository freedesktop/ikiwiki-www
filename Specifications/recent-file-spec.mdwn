## Recent File Storage Specification

Many applications choose to have a menu containing a list of recently used files, which can be used as an alternative to opening a file selector. GNOME, and KDE applications have done this for quite some time, and probably others have as well. This specification aims to do the following things: 

                     * Provide a standard mechanism for storing a list of recently used files (really, URIs) 
                     * Allow for notification of changes in the list
