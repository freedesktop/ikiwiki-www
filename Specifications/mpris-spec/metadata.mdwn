# MPRIS v2 metadata guidelines

It is recommended that xesam metadata fields (prefixed by "xesam:") are used wherever possible.  This allows for natural extension of the specification in a standard way.

There are also a few MPRIS-specific fields that are intended for interaction with other methods in the specification.  These are prefixed with "mpris:".

Any metadata fields that are not part of a xesam ontology or defined in this document should be prefixed with a different tag, such as "totem:" or "kde:".

## Types

<a name="list-of-strings"></a>
### List of Strings

Note that some types that you might expect to be strings are, in fact, "lists of strings".  These should be sent using the "as" D-Bus type (array of string).

<a name="date-time"></a>
### Date/Time

Date/time fields should be sent as strings in ISO 8601 extended format.  If the timezone is known (eg: for xesam:lastPlayed), the internet profile format of ISO 8601, as specified in [RFC 3339](http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#sec-5.6), should be used.

For example: "2007-04-29T13:56+01:00" for 29th April 2007, four minutes to 2pm, in a time zone 1 hour ahead of UTC.

<a name="uri"></a>
### URI

URIs should be sent as strings, and should be suitably encoded.
