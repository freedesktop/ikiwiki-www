# XSETTINGS registry

This page lists the shared settings which are currently under the control of the XSETTINGS system. Desktop configuration interfaces should provide a way to set these. 

Note that currently only GTK supports XSETTINGS, so the distinction between 'all desktops' and 'all GTK desktops' is currently irrelevant. The type and default value is given for each one.
