# The Discoverable Partitions Specification

_TL;DR: Let's automatically discover, mount and enable the root partition, /home, /srv and the swap partitions based on GUID Partition Tables (GPT!)_ 

<table>

<tr>
<th>Partition Type GUID</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Explanation</th>

<tr>
<td><nobr>44479540-f297-41b2-9af7d131d5f0458a</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>Root Partition (x86)</i></nobr></td>
<td>On 32bit x86 systems the first x86 root partition on the disk the EFI ESP is located on is automatically mounted to the root directory /. If the partition is encrypted with LUKS the device mapper file will be named /dev/mapper/root.</td>
</tr>

<td><nobr>4f68bce3-e8cd-4db1-96e7fbcaf984b709</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>Root Partition (x86-64)</i></bobr></td>
<td>On 64bit x86 systems the first x86-64 root partition on the disk the EFI ESP is located on is automatically mounted to the root directory /. If the partition is encrypted with LUKS the device mapper file will be named /dev/mapper/root.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr>933ac7e1-2eb4-4f13-b8440e14e2aef915</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>Home Partition</i></nobr></td>
<td>The first home partition on the disk the root partit.ion is located on is automatically mounted to /home. If the partition is encrypted with LUKS the device mapper file will be named /dev/mapper/home</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr>3b8f8425-20e0-4f3b-907f1a25a76f98e8</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>Server Data Partition</i></nobr></td>
<td>The first server data partition on the disk the root partition is located on is automatically mounted to /srv. If the partition is encrypted with LUKS the device mapper file will be named /dev/mapper/srv.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr>0657fd6d-a4ab-43c4-84e50933c84b4f4f</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>Swap</i></nobr></td>
<td>All swap partitions located on the disk the root partition is located on are automatically enabled.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr>c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>EFI System Partition</i></nobr></td>
<td>The ESP used for the current booting is automatically mounted to /boot.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr>bc13c2ff-59e6-4262-a352-b275fd6f7172</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>Extended Boot Partition</i></nobr></td>
<td>The first extended boot partition is automatically used by installers to place the boot loader in. It is not automatically mounted on normally system boots, unless configured explicitly in /etc/fstab, which installers are supposed to do.</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td><nobr>0fc63daf-8483-4772-8e79-3d69d8477de4</nobr></td>
<td><nobr><i>Other Data Partitions</i></nobr></td>
<td>No automatic mounting takes place for other Linux data partitions. This partition type should be used for all partitions that carry Linux file systems, and the installer needs to mount them explicitly via entries in /etc/fstab. Optionally, these partitions may be encrypted with LUKS.</td>

Other GPT type IDs might be used on Linux, for example to mark software RAID or LVM partitions. The definitions of those GPT types is outside of the scope of this specification.
