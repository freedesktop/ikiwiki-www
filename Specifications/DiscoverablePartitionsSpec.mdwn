# The Discoverable Partitions Specification

_TL;DR: Let's automatically discover, mount and enable the root partition, /home, /srv and the swap partitions based on GUID Partition Tables (GPT!)_

Other GPT type IDs might be used on Linux, for example to mark software RAID or LVM partitions. The definitions of those GPT types is outside of the scope of this specification.

## Suggested Mode of Operation

An *installer* that repartitions the hard disk, should use the above GUID partition types for the partitions it creates. It is recommended to use expressive partition names in the GPT partition table, for example "Home Partition", "Server Data Partition" and similar, possibly localized.

An *installer* which supports a "manual partitioning" UI is recommended to prepopulate the UI with existing swap, /home and /srv partitions identified with the GPT type GUIDS above. Note that it shall only prepopulate the UI with the Extended Boot Partition if its boot loader supports the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/BootLoaderSpec/">Boot Loader Specification</a>. The installer should not prepopulate such an UI with any identified root partition unless the intention is too overwrite an existing operating system that might be installed.

An *installer* may omit creating entries in /etc/fstab for root, /home, /srv and for the swap partitions if they use these GUID partition types, and are the first partitions on the disk of each type. If the ESP shall be mounted to /boot it may omit creating entries in /etc/fstab for it, too. If an extended boot partition is used or if the EFI partition shall not be mounted to /boot it *must* create /etc/fstab entries for them. If other partitions are used (for example for /var or /usr, the installer *must* register these in /etc/fstab. The root= parameter passed to the kernel by the boot loader may be omitted too, if the root partition is the first one on the disk of its type. If the root partition is not the first one on the disk, the root= parameter *must* be passed to the kernel by the boot loader. An installer that mounts a root, /home or /srv file system with the partition types defined as above which contains a LUKS header *must* call the device mapper device "root", "home" and "srv". This is necessary to ensure that the automatic discovery will never result in different device mapper names thant any static configuration by the installer.

An *operating* *system* should automatically discover and mount the root file system, by looking on the disk the EFI ESP used to boot is located on. It should automatically discover and mount the /home, /srv and swap partitions by looking on the disk the root partition is located on. It should automatically discover and mount the /boot partition to the ESP used for booting. It should not discover/mount partitions with other GUID partition types, or partitions located on other disks. User configuration shall always override automatic discovery and mounting. If a root, /home, /srv, /boot file system or swap partition is listed in /etc/fstab it shall always take precedence over automatically discovered partitions. If a /home, /srv, /boot file system is found to be populated already the automatic discovery shall not overmount it with any discovered file system.

If a btrfs file system is automatically discovered and mounted by the operating system it will be mounted with its *default* subvolume. The installer should make sure to set the default subvolume correctly using "btrfs  subvolume set-default".

## Sharing of File Systems between Installations

If two (Linux-based) operating systems are installed on the same disk, the scheme above suggests that they may share the Swap, /home, /srv, ESP and Extended Boot Partition. However, they should each have their own root partition.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What about automatic discovery of /var, /usr or /etc partitions?

Partitions for /home, /srv or swap may be shared relatively painlessly between multiple OS installations on the same disk. The same is not true for /var, /usr and /etc which belong closely to one specific root partition and need to be updated in close synchronization with each other. Since the GPT partition table scheme cannot express which sets of partitions belong to a single OS installation and to avoid the risk of mixing and matching incorrect combinations of these partitions we decided to not defined auto-discovery of these partition types within this specification.

### What about automatic mounting of btrfs subvolumes to /var, /home and so on?

Doing a similar automatic discovery of btrfs subvolumes and mounting them automatically to the appropriate places is certainly disarable. We are waiting for the btrfs designers to add a per-subvolume type UUID to their disk format to make this possible.

### Why are you taking my /etc/fstab away?

We are not. /etc/fstab always overrides automatic discovery. We are just trying to make the boot and installation processes of Linux a bit more robust and self-explanatory.
