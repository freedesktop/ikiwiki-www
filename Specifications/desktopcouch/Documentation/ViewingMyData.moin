You can see all your desktopcouch databases in the "Futon" web interface by running this command from a terminal window (Applications > Accessories > Terminal):

`xdg-open ~/.local/share/desktop-couch/couchdb.html`

If this command doesn't work (for example, you are asked for a password) then restart desktopcouch as described on the [[Troubleshooting]] page.
