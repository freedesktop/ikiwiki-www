Says Chad, """Song IDs should be changed to be independent of some other index. It could be exact file names or a well-defined hash of the contents of a canonical version of the file.  I think file_length_in_base10_ascii+SHA224_as_hex of the file conntents is okay.  To get something Ubuntu One stores internally, we should add a lookup table in our application_annotations. 

         * "application_annotations": { 
                     * "Ubuntu One": { 
                                    * id-map: { 
                                                   * "d5d8b9cbfdce7b1691a2528e0ffed0b4e4f7b63ab71bdba4ab44c083": "12345", "3ab97c9a01e238185933126951046f289593159d83d4d64cc11382dc": "2345678", }

Says Martin, Done.
