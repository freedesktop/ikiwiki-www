# Windows X11 Driver


## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop an Windows display driver which uses X11 as output.  


## Design

The driver will act as a mirror driver and will not replace the normal display driver of  windows. All drawing activities are serialized into a stream protocol which is readable  by a client application. The client application will convert the stream protocol into  coresponding X11 calls and will manage window creation/closing, remote mouse and keyboard  input. 


## Steps

                     * Get the mirror driver sample from the MS DDK running 
                     * Create serialization of the driver function calls 
                     * Translate the serialization to X11 (code from wine x11drv may help) 
                     * Implement keyboard and mouse input 
                     * Provide 1-1 window mapping between Windows and X11
