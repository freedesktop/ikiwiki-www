High Dynamic Range (HDR) images most be converted to Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to display properly on print media and traditional TV's and Monitors. For better prediction of the colour appearance, a way to describe the algorythm used on the authors side seems desirable. With such a description a viewer can display the HDR content according to the remote media capabilities.
