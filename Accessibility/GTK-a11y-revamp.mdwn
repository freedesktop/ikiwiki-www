# Revamping the GTK accessibility stack?

### URLs

Discussion sort-of started here (but not only)

https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/1739#note_685570


### Strong issues

* AT-SPI allows any application to access information, act on the application etc.
* key snooping makes *all* keypresses go through the screen reader, thus making the whole desktop slower


### Ideas for solutions

* Checking authorization before allowing connection to AT-SPI
* Separating out key press notification from keyboard shortcuts:
  * key press notification can be asynchronous, thus not slowing desktop down
  * only keyboard shortcut would have to go through the screen reader
