### Only a keyboard

Needs keyboard shortcuts, MouseKeys.

### Only a joystick

Being able to use it as a mouse

### Only a mouse or button

Using a virtual keyboard.

### Half-keyboard

For people with one hand, using a toggle to "mirror" the keyboard layout. Some implementations use xkb: 
[[http://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/]] , others use extensions: [[http://kieranbingham.co.uk/implementing-xhk/]] , [[https://github.com/kbingham/xhk]]

### AccessX

Done in Xorg, TBD in Wayland

* StickyKeys
* MouseKeys
* SlowKeys
* RepeatKeys
* ToggleKeys
* BounceKeys

### Key injection

We need to be able to inject both untranslated key presses and translated keypresses, as some specific devices or handling happen to provide both of them.

* keycode injection
 * Available in Xorg through XTest
* keysym injection
 * Not available in Xorg, have to backtranslate.
 * Could be done by adding EV_KEYSYM and EV_UNICODE to evdev layer.

Wayland: this is completely missing apparently?

### PC braille keyboard

* Available in Xorg as the brai xkb layout
* ibus module available: [[https://gitlab.com/smc/ibus-braille]]
