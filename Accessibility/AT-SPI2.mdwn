### AT-SPI2

This is over DBus, toolkit widgets provide their content to screen readers such as Orca.

The core that defines the protocol and starts the dbus accessibility bus is [[at-spi2-core|https://github.com/GNOME/at-spi2-core]]

Getting it started by hand (normally done by the Desktop Environment session manager):

* /usr/lib/at-spi2-core/at-spi-bus-launcher &
* /usr/lib/at-spi2-core/at-spi2-registryd &
* one can make sure it got registered by using

        $ xprop -root | grep SPI
        AT_SPI_BUS(STRING) = "unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-6fNHBTP2lK,guid=9d17aaa3ca64ff4b66f0c5985442999e"

* That was the bus address, one can watch what happens by spying on it:

        $ dbus-monitor --address unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-6fNHBTP2lK,guid=9d17aaa3ca64ff4b66f0c5985442999e

* Some applications need explicit accessibility enabling:

        export GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge
        export OOO_FORCE_DESKTOP=gnome
        export GNOME_ACCESSIBILITY=1
        export QT_ACCESSIBILITY=1
