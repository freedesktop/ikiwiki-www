Also see [[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Wayland_features]]

* Speech should get interrupted by navigation [[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=919417]]
* xbrlapi needs a replacement to be able to synthesize keys coming from the braille device
* Orca needs to be able to catch capslock/insert key events, and synthesize them.
* Mouse event synthesis is not working : [[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709999]] : Orca's flat review feature to click on elements requires that being fixed.
* Accessible mouse-moved events are not emitted : [[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=710012]] : Orca's mouse review feature depends on this.
* Also see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/issues/9]]
* Also see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/issues/42]]
* dogtail needs to be able to synthesize keypresses, see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/ofourdan/gnome-ponytail-daemon]]
* ATK needs to return absolute coordinates of widgets, for proper zoom positioning etc. see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/ofourdan/gnome-ponytail-daemon]]
* PolicyKit needs to be notified of the VT the user is logged in, so that brlapi polkit authentication can work.
