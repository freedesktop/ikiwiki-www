Input

* Speech should get interrupted by navigation [[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=919417]]
* Mouse event synthesis is not working : [[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709999]] : Orca's flat review feature to click on elements requires that being fixed.
* Accessible mouse-moved events are not emitted : [[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=710012]] : Orca's mouse review feature depends on this.
* window frame coordinates always 0,0 on wayland : [[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=797424]] : ezoom's positioning and tactos' global view depend on this.
* Also see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/issues/9]] (add API for a11y input control)
* Also see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/issues/42]] (Wayland: Implement mouse accessibility)
* Orca needs to be able to catch capslock/insert key events, and synthesize them.
* xbrlapi needs a replacement to be able to synthesize keys coming from the braille device
* dogtail needs to be able to synthesize keypresses, see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/ofourdan/gnome-ponytail-daemon]]
  * Just like autotype tools like keepassx that need to type the password, see https://github.com/keepassx/keepassx/blob/b654fde9cd43202903c0e9e08b2043315335759b/src/autotype/xcb/AutoTypeXCB.cpp

Output

* ATK needs to return absolute coordinates of widgets, for proper zoom positioning etc. see [[https://gitlab.gnome.org/ofourdan/gnome-ponytail-daemon]]

Misc

* PolicyKit needs to be notified of the VT the user is logged in, so that brlapi polkit authentication can work.
* Qt5 is not accessible at all: [[https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-73945]]
