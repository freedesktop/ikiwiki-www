= Xming =
Xming is the port of the X Window System to Microsoft Windows. Unlike [[CygwinX|Cygwin/X]] it does not depend on the [[http://www.cygwin.com|Cygwin]] environment.

Xming is currently maintained by Colin Harrison and is hosted on [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming|SourceForge]]

Because the information on this page was not updated for over two years and did in some parts not reflect the current development and beacuse some people still mail me instead of the mailinglist I decided to remove all content. Please use the wiki [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Xming?action=recall&rev=51|history]] if you want to access any information previously available on this page.
