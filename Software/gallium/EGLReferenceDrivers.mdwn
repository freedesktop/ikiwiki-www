This page contains the instructions for building the OpenGL and OpenVG Gallium Softpipe EGL/Linux reference drivers. 

Optionally, you can download an entire virtual machine image with the entire EGL build and environment already installed.  [[Instructions|http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gallium/EGLReferenceDrivers/linuxvmimage]] on how to download VMware's player and the Gallium3D Reference Image. 

   1. Get latest Mesa3D repository. It's where Gallium3D is hosted right now.[[!format txt """
git clone git://git.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/mesa
"""]]
   1. Compile Mesa3D in a way that compiles Gallium3D and software driver.[[!format txt """
cd mesa
export GALLIUM=$PWD
make linux-x86-debug
"""]]
   1. Compile OpenVG if you want to.[[!format txt """
cd src/gallium/state_trackers/vega
make
cd $GALLIUM
"""]]
   1. Make sure that from now on all apps pick up your newly compiled Gallium libs.[[!format txt """
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GALLIUM/lib/gallium:$GALLIUM/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
"""]]
   1. Make sure Gallium's EGL implementation is using the software driver.[[!format txt """
export EGL_DRIVER="egl_softpipe"
"""]]
   1. Play around with demos.[[!format txt """
cd progs/openvg/demos
make
./sp
./lion
