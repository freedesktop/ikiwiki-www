== Desktop VFS ==

Desktop VFS aims to provide a system allowing desktop-oriented applications, such as file managers and office applications among others, to have access to remote data storage facilities using a Virtual File System API.

D-VFS is not oriented towards general purpose usage.  The design goal is specifically desktop applications and their needs.  The project is not an attempt to build a low-level system-wide VFS (see [http://fuse.sourceforge.net FUSE]) but instead is an attempt to establish an API based on the operations desktop application wish to perform.  For example, instead of building on the POSIX API, the D-VFS API will be based on operations like "save whole document," "read whole document," "list files in folder," and so on.

D-VFS is in the first stages of design. The requirements and api are being fleshed out at this location.  Adding your comments to the design of D-VFS is very simple.
