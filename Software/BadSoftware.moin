This is a list of software that doesn't support [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode Unicode] properly, or at all. Please note that we do not consider [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16 UTF-16] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32 UTF-32] support adequate (or [http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr26/ CESU-8], for that matter). There is also [:Software/BMP-Only: another page] for software that doesn't support characters outside the [:Software/BMP: Basic Multilingual Plane]. [http://www.jacksonh.net/jackson/images/godkills_bugs.jpg Please file bug reports] whenever possible, and be sure to let us know about them.

<!-- Note to editors: Please keep this list in alphabetical order. Thank you. -->

	* [http://aterm.sourceforge.net/ Aterm]: Appears to [http://home.comcast.net/~alexander.winston/aterm.png fail unfortunately] when attempting to read [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ Markus Kuhn's] [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-demo.txt UTF-8 demonstration document].
	* [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html Emacs]: The [http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=emacs CVS version] is [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2004-06/msg00020.html unable to uppercase] lowercase characters that map to multiple uppercase characters.
	* [http://www.ximian.com/products/evolution/ Evolution]: [http://www.pango.org/ Pango] is used improperly in !GtkHtml, so [http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41763 right-to-left text is displayed incorrectly].
	* [http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/ Flex]: Unicode support is very basic. There is no support for dealing with `wchar_t` strings, and the regular expression matching is limited to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII US-ASCII].
	* [http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-print/ gnome-print]: [http://www.pango.org/ Pango] is [http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125762 not used for printing].
	* [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ GNU Arch]: `tla` does not accept anything other than simple letters, numbers, and basic punctuation in `my-id`. It encounters problems with [http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=7078 umlauts], [http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=7862 underscores], and other [http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=5555 âfunky charactersâ].
	* [http://www.gnupg.org/ GPG]: Configuration files contain a setting that communicates the character set that is wanted. There is a notice near this setting claiming that UTF-8 will be the default in the next version. However, in !CVS revision HEAD, the default remains ISO-8859-1.
	* [http://www.gnu.org/software/grep grep]: [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ Markus Kuhn] [http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/2003-11/msg00027.html noticed] that grep 2.5 is very slow in UTF-8 locales; [http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/2003-11/msg00168.html Mika Fischer posted a patch] that you may want to try.
	* [http://nostatic.org/grip/ Grip] has problems with UTF-8 in [http://www.id3.org/ ID3] tags. See [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=854558&group_id=3714&atid=103714  #854558] and [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=852783&group_id=3714&atid=103714 #852783]
	* [http://id3v2.sourceforge.net/ ID3v2] (an MP3 tagging tool) doesn't set the encoding flag of the text fields in the ID3v2 tags to UTF-8, which thus are not shown correctly in most players/music organizers. See [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=232307 this] bug report for details.
	* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/joe-editor/ joe]: [mailto:lhh@redhat.com Lon Hohberger] said, âI looked at it briefly, but I didn't get too far before more important things came up. On a side note, it's probably much easier to write a `joe.elisp` or `joe.vim` :)â
	* [http://www.kernel.org/ Linux kernel]: Console: Can display UTF-8 characters after configured using [ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/utils/kbd/ kbd] package. Console can show 256 or 512 different characters at same time. Supported already in distributions such as Fedora, Mandrake, etc. Unicode input is problematic for composing (using a dead key to add accents to characters) as diacritics [http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3922 must be 8-bits], allowing ISO 8859, but not UTF-8. You can input UTF-8 characters by assigning one key to one Unicode character. The issue of diacritics looks difficult to solve in an easy way.
	* man-pages: Manual pages for character sets like ISO-8859-1 [http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108991 are not encoded in UTF-8].
	* newt: Has problems with multibyte characters, entering UTF-8 characters.
	* [http://www.ibiblio.org/mc/ mc]: The Red Hat/[http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora] Linux packages contain patches that fix the main interface, but not the viewer or editor. [http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/SRPMS/mc-4.6.0-6.src.rpm Grab the source RPM] for the patches. There are also patches from Suse available: [http://www.suse.de/~nadvornik/mc.html Suse Patches]
	* strings, part of [http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/ binutils], does not support UTF-8.
	* [http://tcsh.org tcsh]: This shell has issues: âUnicode (UTF-8) doesn't seem to workâ. This is on their [http://www.tcsh.org/WishList wish list], though. Setting the variable dspmbyte to utf8 seems to solve the problem, however [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89549 you have to set it explicitely]. There are bugs when editing a command line with UTF-8 characters.
	* [http://twiki.org/ TWiki]: See http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/ProposedUTF8SupportForI18N for the latest information.
	* [http://wordpress.org WordPress]: There's no current plan to support UTF-8, and there were no responses to a [http://wordpress.org/support/4/1098 request] to use anything other than ISO-8859-1. *Update* (2004-03): This appears to be mostly resolved in their CVS.
	* [http://www.zsh.org Zsh]: The Z Shell has partial support for UTF-8. For example, pasted UTF-8-encoded Latin characters display OK, but other characters such as the 3-byte UTF-8 single quote (â) or many Asian characters do not. Zsh also has trouble moving the cursor around multi-byte characters (such as using backspace). Tab completion will match files but probably not display them correctly. A \u escape for generating Unicode characters is supported. In the current unstable (4.3) branch a lot of progress has been made in adding support for unicode from the line editor and help in testing this would be much appreciated by the developers. It is a big job, in part because zsh's useful feature of being able to handle null characters is being preserved.
