This is a list of software that doesn't support [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode|Unicode]] properly, or at all. Please note that we do not consider [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16|UTF-16]] or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32|UTF-32]] support adequate (or [[http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr26/|CESU-8]], for that matter). There is also [[Software/BMP-Only| another page]] for software that doesn't support characters outside the [[Software/BMP| Basic Multilingual Plane]]. [[http://www.jacksonh.net/jackson/images/godkills_bugs.jpg|Please file bug reports]] whenever possible, and be sure to let us know about them.

<!-- Note to editors: Please keep this list in alphabetical order. Thank you. -->

	* [[http://aterm.sourceforge.net/|Aterm]]: Appears to [[http://web.archive.org/web/20040519000109/http://home.comcast.net/~alexander.winston/aterm.png|fail unfortunately]] when attempting to read [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/|Markus Kuhn's]] [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-demo.txt|UTF-8 demonstration document]].
	* [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html|Emacs]]: The [[http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=emacs|CVS version]] is [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2004-06/msg00020.html|unable to uppercase]] lowercase characters that map to multiple uppercase characters.
	* [[http://www.ximian.com/products/evolution/|Evolution]]: [[http://www.pango.org/|Pango]] is used improperly in !GtkHtml, so [[http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41763|right-to-left text is displayed incorrectly]].
	* [[http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/|Flex]]: Unicode support is very basic. There is no support for dealing with `wchar_t` strings, and the regular expression matching is limited to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII|US-ASCII]].
	* [[http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-print/|gnome-print]]: [[http://www.pango.org/|Pango]] is [[http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125762|not used for printing]].
	* [[http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/|GNU Arch]]: `tla` does not accept anything other than simple letters, numbers, and basic punctuation in `my-id`. It encounters problems with [[http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=7078|umlauts]], [[http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=7862|underscores]], and other [[http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=5555|âfunky charactersâ]].
	* [[http://www.gnupg.org/|GPG]]: Configuration files contain a setting that communicates the character set that is wanted. There is a notice near this setting claiming that UTF-8 will be the default in the next version. However, in !CVS revision HEAD, the default remains ISO-8859-1.
	* [[http://www.gnu.org/software/grep|grep]]: [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/|Markus Kuhn]] [[http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/2003-11/msg00027.html|noticed]] that grep 2.5 is very slow in UTF-8 locales; [[http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/2003-11/msg00168.html|Mika Fischer posted a patch]] that you may want to try.
	* [[http://nostatic.org/grip/|Grip]] has problems with UTF-8 in [[http://www.id3.org/|ID3]] tags. See [[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=854558&group_id=3714&atid=103714|#854558]] and [[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=852783&group_id=3714&atid=103714|#852783]]
	* [[http://id3v2.sourceforge.net/|ID3v2]] (an MP3 tagging tool) doesn't set the encoding flag of the text fields in the ID3v2 tags to UTF-8, which thus are not shown correctly in most players/music organizers. See [[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=232307|this]] bug report for details.
	* [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/joe-editor/|joe]]: [[mailto:lhh@redhat.com|Lon Hohberger]] said, âI looked at it briefly, but I didn't get too far before more important things came up. On a side note, it's probably much easier to write a `joe.elisp` or `joe.vim` :)â
	* [[http://www.kernel.org/|Linux kernel]]: Console: Can display UTF-8 characters after configured using [[ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/utils/kbd/|kbd]] package. Console can show 256 or 512 different characters at same time. Supported already in distributions such as Fedora, Mandrake, etc. Unicode input is problematic for composing (using a dead key to add accents to characters) as diacritics [[http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3922|must be 8-bits]], allowing ISO 8859, but not UTF-8. You can input UTF-8 characters by assigning one key to one Unicode character. The issue of diacritics looks difficult to solve in an easy way.
	* man-pages: Manual pages for character sets like ISO-8859-1 [[http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108991|are not encoded in UTF-8]].
	* newt: Has problems with multibyte characters, entering UTF-8 characters.
	* [[http://www.ibiblio.org/mc/|mc]]: The Red Hat/[[http://fedora.redhat.com/|Fedora]] Linux packages contain patches that fix the main interface, but not the viewer or editor. [[http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/SRPMS/mc-4.6.0-6.src.rpm|Grab the source RPM]] for the patches. There are also patches from Suse available: [[http://www.suse.de/~nadvornik/mc.html|Suse Patches]]
	* strings, part of [[http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/|binutils]], does not support UTF-8.
	* [[http://tcsh.org|tcsh]]: This shell has issues: âUnicode (UTF-8) doesn't seem to workâ. This is on their [[http://www.tcsh.org/WishList|wish list]], though. Setting the variable dspmbyte to utf8 seems to solve the problem, however [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89549|you have to set it explicitely]]. There are bugs when editing a command line with UTF-8 characters.
	* [[http://twiki.org/|TWiki]]: See http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/ProposedUTF8SupportForI18N for the latest information.
	* [[http://wordpress.org|WordPress]]: There's no current plan to support UTF-8, and there were no responses to a [[http://wordpress.org/support/4/1098|request]] to use anything other than ISO-8859-1. *Update* (2004-03): This appears to be mostly resolved in their CVS.
	* [[http://www.zsh.org|Zsh]]: The Z Shell has partial support for UTF-8. For example, pasted UTF-8-encoded Latin characters display OK, but other characters such as the 3-byte UTF-8 single quote (â) or many Asian characters do not. Zsh also has trouble moving the cursor around multi-byte characters (such as using backspace). Tab completion will match files but probably not display them correctly. A \u escape for generating Unicode characters is supported. In the current unstable (4.3) branch a lot of progress has been made in adding support for unicode from the line editor and help in testing this would be much appreciated by the developers. It is a big job, in part because zsh's useful feature of being able to handle null characters is being preserved.
