## Getting the sources

libetonyek sources are stored in [[git|http://git-scm.com/]].  To get them, you can use: 
[[!format txt """
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/libreoffice/libetonyek/
"""]]
or you can browse the code [[online|http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/libetonyek/]]. 

If you want to use release version you can fetch it from [[libreoffice mirror|http://dev-www.libreoffice.org/src/]]. 


## Building it


### Dependencies

You will need these applications in order to compile libetonyek: 
[[!format txt """
boost
gperf
>=libwpd-0.9
libxml2
zlib
cppunit # optional for unit tests (--enable-tests)
doxygen # optional for documentation building (--with-docs)
"""]]
Once the source has been checked out, libetonyek can be built in usual manner: 
[[!format txt """
cd libetonyek
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
"""]]

## Contributing

Once you have done a change that you are happy with, and that builds with libetonyek, contribute it back, we'll be happy to integrate it!
There are two ways to get your contribution to us:

1. submitting it to gerrit (preferred, easier if you already have
   done the initial setup)
1. sending a patch

Both methods require that you commit the changes to your local
repository first:
[[!format txt """
git commit -a
"""]]
The submission differs by method and is discussed in the following
sections.

### Gerrit
This section draws heavily on documentation for libreoffice.

You need to have an account in [[libreoffice
gerrit|https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/]]. How to do that is discussed in
length
[[here|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/setup]]
(the logerrit tool is in libreoffice repo, but the manual way works).
After you have done that, you are ready to push your change(s). How to
do that manually is described
    [[here|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/SubmitPatch]].
    Alternatively, there is a tool called
    [[git-review|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GitReview]]
    that makes it (IMHO) much easier.

As an example, if you are using
[[git-review|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GitReview]],
you submit you change(s) with plain
[[!format txt """
git review
"""]]

### Sending patches
[[!format txt """
git format-patch origin/master
"""]]
will create one or more patch files. You can send these to
[[libreoffice@lists.freedesktop.org|mailto:libreoffice@lists.freedesktop.org]] .
