This is a list of software that doesn't support [[Unicode|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode]] properly, or at all. Please note that we do not consider [[UTF-16|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16]] or [[UTF-32|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32]] support adequate (or [[CESU-8|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr26/]], for that matter). There is also [[another page|Software/BMP-Only]] for software that doesn't support characters outside the [[Basic Multilingual Plane|Software/BMP]]. [[Please file bug reports|http://www.jacksonh.net/jackson/images/godkills_bugs.jpg]] whenever possible, and be sure to let us know about them. 

<!-- Note to editors: Please keep this list in alphabetical order. Thank you. --> 

                     * [[Aterm|http://aterm.sourceforge.net/]]: Appears to [[fail unfortunately|http://web.archive.org/web/20040519000109/http://home.comcast.net/~alexander.winston/aterm.png]] when attempting to read [[Markus Kuhn's|http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/]] [[UTF-8 demonstration document|http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-demo.txt]]. 
                     * [[Emacs|http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html]]: The [[CVS version|http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=emacs]] is [[unable to uppercase|http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2004-06/msg00020.html]] lowercase characters that map to multiple uppercase characters. 
                     * [[Evolution|http://www.ximian.com/products/evolution/]]: [[Pango|http://www.pango.org/]] is used improperly in GtkHtml, so [[right-to-left text is displayed incorrectly|http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41763]]. 
                     * [[Flex|http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/]]: Unicode support is very basic. There is no support for dealing with `wchar_t` strings, and the regular expression matching is limited to [[US-ASCII|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII]]. 
                     * [[gnome-print|http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-print/]]: [[Pango|http://www.pango.org/]] is [[not used for printing|http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125762]]. 
                     * [[GNU Arch|http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/]]: `tla` does not accept anything other than simple letters, numbers, and basic punctuation in `my-id`. It encounters problems with [[umlauts|http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=7078]], [[underscores|http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=7862]], and other [[âfunky charactersâ|http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=5555]]. 
                     * [[GPG|http://www.gnupg.org/]]: Configuration files contain a setting that communicates the character set that is wanted. There is a notice near this setting claiming that UTF-8 will be the default in the next version. However, in !CVS revision HEAD, the default remains ISO-8859-1. 
                     * [[grep|http://www.gnu.org/software/grep]]: [[Markus Kuhn|http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/]] [[noticed|http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/2003-11/msg00027.html]] that grep 2.5 is very slow in UTF-8 locales; [[Mika Fischer posted a patch|http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/2003-11/msg00168.html]] that you may want to try. 
                     * [[Grip|http://nostatic.org/grip/]] has problems with UTF-8 in [[ID3|http://www.id3.org/]] tags. See [[#854558|http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=854558&group_id=3714&atid=103714]] and [[#852783|http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=852783&group_id=3714&atid=103714]] 
                     * [[ID3v2|http://id3v2.sourceforge.net/]] (an MP3 tagging tool) doesn't set the encoding flag of the text fields in the ID3v2 tags to UTF-8, which thus are not shown correctly in most players/music organizers. See [[this|http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=232307]] bug report for details. 
                     * [[joe|http://sourceforge.net/projects/joe-editor/]]: [[Lon Hohberger|mailto:lhh@redhat.com]] said, âI looked at it briefly, but I didn't get too far before more important things came up. On a side note, it's probably much easier to write a `joe.elisp` or `joe.vim` :)â 
                     * [[Linux kernel|http://www.kernel.org/]]: Console: Can display UTF-8 characters after configured using [[kbd|ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/utils/kbd/]] package. Console can show 256 or 512 different characters at same time. Supported already in distributions such as Fedora, Mandrake, etc. Unicode input is problematic for composing (using a dead key to add accents to characters) as diacritics [[must be 8-bits|http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3922]], allowing ISO 8859, but not UTF-8. You can input UTF-8 characters by assigning one key to one Unicode character. The issue of diacritics looks difficult to solve in an easy way. 
                     * man-pages: Manual pages for character sets like ISO-8859-1 [[are not encoded in UTF-8|http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108991]]. 
                     * newt: Has problems with multibyte characters, entering UTF-8 characters. 
                     * [[mc|http://www.ibiblio.org/mc/]]: The Red Hat/[[Fedora|http://fedora.redhat.com/]] Linux packages contain patches that fix the main interface, but not the viewer or editor. [[Grab the source RPM|http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/SRPMS/mc-4.6.0-6.src.rpm]] for the patches. There are also patches from Suse available: [[Suse Patches|http://www.suse.de/~nadvornik/mc.html]] 
                     * strings, part of [[binutils|http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/]], does not support UTF-8. 
                     * [[tcsh|http://tcsh.org]]: This shell has issues: âUnicode (UTF-8) doesn't seem to workâ. This is on their [[wish list|http://www.tcsh.org/WishList]], though. Setting the variable dspmbyte to utf8 seems to solve the problem, however [[you have to set it explicitely|https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89549]]. There are bugs when editing a command line with UTF-8 characters. 
                     * [[TWiki|http://twiki.org/]]: See [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/ProposedUTF8SupportForI18N|http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/ProposedUTF8SupportForI18N]] for the latest information. 
                     * [[WordPress|http://wordpress.org]]: There's no current plan to support UTF-8, and there were no responses to a [[request|http://wordpress.org/support/4/1098]] to use anything other than ISO-8859-1. *Update* (2004-03): This appears to be mostly resolved in their CVS. 
                     * [[Zsh|http://www.zsh.org]]: The Z Shell has partial support for UTF-8. For example, pasted UTF-8-encoded Latin characters display OK, but other characters such as the 3-byte UTF-8 single quote (â) or many Asian characters do not. Zsh also has trouble moving the cursor around multi-byte characters (such as using backspace). Tab completion will match files but probably not display them correctly. A \u escape for generating Unicode characters is supported. In the current unstable (4.3) branch a lot of progress has been made in adding support for unicode from the line editor and help in testing this would be much appreciated by the developers. It is a big job, in part because zsh's useful feature of being able to handle null characters is being preserved.
