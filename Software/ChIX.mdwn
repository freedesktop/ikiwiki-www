The project is busy moving to freedesktop.org 

The current wiki used in freedesktop.org UTF8 support is still a problem. I'm looking for approaches to workaround this problem. 

This project aims to provide a common and standalone Chinese input system for the X window. The ChIX input platform should be able to work without any other X11-toolkits like gtk / qt, and easy extendable. 

Currently the project is just started. The prject has not released first version yet. However we are working to publish the fonts first.
