### 2.1 Release

                     * I've gathered up current CVS (as of 2002-11-21) and put together fcpackage 2.1. This fixes various issues: 
                     * Export some more Xft symbols (Cygwin) that are needed for qt 3.x (#5285, Ralf Habacker) 
                     * Add a bunch more consts to Xft and fontconfig apis 
                     * Update Xft manual (it's still pretty lame) 
                     * Make handling of RGBA constants more consistent and less error prone 
                     * Remove prototype Xft configuration file; its not used anymore 
                     * Destroy images when drawing glyphs with the core protocol 
                     * Remove unnecessary link between FC RGBA values and Render subpixel order constants 
                     * Add image transformation and sub-pixel ordering to Render 
                     * Fix file/face locking to make it more sensible 
                     * Render uses int for 32 bits, Xlib uses long. This matters on alpha 
                     * Miscomputing request length for String16 and String32 
                     * Obey max request length even with BIG-REQUESTS for Trapezoids 
                     * Skip unexpected data in [[QueryFormats|QueryFormats]]. Deal with broken X servers a bit better 
                     * XRenderQueryPictIndexValues support (from Olivier Chapuis). Bump Render version to 0.7 
                     * Fix fontconfig to obey [[NothingOutsideProjectRoot|NothingOutsideProjectRoot]], so that the directory /usr/share/fonts is ignored in this case (#A.1325, Joe Moss). 
                     * Change comments a bit in fonts.conf.in 
                     * Add a bunch more blank glyphs, plus label existing blanks with official unicode names 
                     * Elide historic cyrillic letters from several orthographies as they are unnecessary for modern documents and ill supported by fonts 
                     * English orthography included 0xd. instead of 0xe. for several codepoints. Oops 
                     * Add FC_RGBA_UNKNOWN 
                     * Add fontversion field 
                     * Was losing local cached dirs in global cache list 
                     * In debugging output, mark weakly bound values with (w) 
                     * Pacify gcc 3.2 
                     * Fix alignment issue on sparc 
                     * Fix structure alignment and array wlk bugs Get release 2.1 [[here|http://pdx.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/releases/fcpackage.2_1.tar.gz]]. 

### 2.0 Release

                     * The first release of Fontconfig is 2.0. Yes, this should by all rights be named 1.0, but there was an earlier library used by XFree86 called 'Xft' which had a 1.0 release and as fontconfig now ships version 2 of Xft, it made some (small) amount of sense to just label the whole mess 2.0. Get release 2.0 [[here|http://pdx.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/releases/fcpackage.2_0.tar.gz]].
