=== Fontconfig 2.2.96 ===

!FcConfigUpToDate had some bugs rendering it useless.  Thanks to Lubos Lunak for fixes.  Also, picky C compilers whined about a spurious comma in an enum.  The bits are available [http://freedesktop.org/fontconfig/release/fontconfig-2.2.96.tar.gz here]. The !ChangeLog since 2.2.95 is available [http://freedesktop.org/fontconfig/release/ChangeLog-2.2.96 here].

=== Fontconfig 2.2.95 ===

Fontconfig was using MIN/MAX/ABS macros that happened to come from FreeType.  FreeType 2.1.8 (wisely) prefixes those names  with FT'' now.  Fontconfig was changed to have it's own versions of these macros (FC''MIN/FC''MAX/FC''ABS) to avoid problems in the future.  A few other minor changes are included in this release.  The bits are available [http://freedesktop.org/fontconfig/release/fontconfig-2.2.95.tar.gz here]. The !ChangeLog since 2.2.94 is available [http://freedesktop.org/fontconfig/release/ChangeLog-2.2.95 here].

=== Fontconfig 2.2.94 ===

Fontconfig 2.2.93 was packaged with a broken version of libtool.  That's the only
change for fontconfig 2.2.94.  The bits are available
