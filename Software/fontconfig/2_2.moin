=== 2.2 Release ===

	Fontconfig version 2.2 has been released.  All of these versions can be found in the [http://freedesktop.org/~fontconfig/release release directory] normally, but are currently unavailable for unknown reasons.  Hopefully, the maintainer of the release directory will notice this Wiki edit and fix it.

	Release 2.2.3:
	* Merge Windows changes from HEAD (Tor Lillqvist)
	* Merge fix for bug #387 from HEAD (Pedro Gimeno)
	* Merge code to handle !FreeType changes in y_ppem/height
	* Merge fixes for !FcConfigUpToDate (Lubos Lunak)

	Release 2.2.2:
	* Changed #include syntax to follow new Freetype rules
	* Made external compilation work

	Release 2.2.1:
	* Fixed a few build issues
	* Fixed a serious bug in pattern editing code that could lead to crashes
	* Cleaned up a few font information collection bits

	Release 2.2.0:
	* Change version number to 2.2.0

	Prerelease 2.1.94:
	* BDF property support for foundry and width (Juliusz Chroboczek)
	* Clean up GCC warnings (Colin Walters)

	Prerelease 2.1.93:
	* Use Type1 FontInfoRec to get more detailed weight information
	* Run fc-cache from source tree to try and resolve LFS install issues
	* Fix fontconfig-user.html generation (was getting smashed)
	* Debian build files are in CVS now
	* Fixes to build on Windows
	* Compute monospacing by looking at glyphs instead of trusting font
	* Get widths and more detailed weight from TrueType OS/2 table
	* Global cache was re-statting a lot of files.
	* Yet more RPM fixes from RedHat

	As always, testing in weird environments would be greatly appreciated. I'm hoping to ship 2.2 soon if 2.1.93 doesn't have a lot of significant. problems
