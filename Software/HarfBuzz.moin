HarfBuzz is an [[http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/|OpenType]] text shaping engine.  There are two HarfBuzz code trees in existence today:

 * The current HarfBuzz tree, also known as harfbuzz-ng, is under active development and is what is used in Firefox, GNOME, recent versions of ChromeOS and Chrome Linux, among other places.  The canonical source tree is available [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/|here]].  See below for release tarballs.

 * The old HarfBuzz tree, derived from [[http://freetype.org/|FreeType]], [[http://pango.org/|Pango]], and [[http://www.trolltech.com/|Qt]], is available [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz.old/|here]].  It is not actively developed or maintained, and is buggy.  All users are encouraged to switch over to the new HarfBuzz.  There are no release tarballs of old HarfBuzz whatsoever.


=== Download ===

For tarball releases of the new HarfBuzz codebase, look [[http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/|here]].  The API is not expected to change incompatibly, but we cannot guarantee that until HarfBuzz 1.0.0 is released.

There are no tarball releases of the old HarfBuzz codebase available.  If you want to use the old HarfBuzz, just import it into your project.


=== Development ===

To get a better idea of where HarfBuzz stands in the text rendering stack you may want to read [[http://behdad.org/text/|State of Text Rendering]].

Both development and user support discussion around HarfBuzz happens on the [[http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/harfbuzz/|harfbuzz at lists freedesktop org]] mailing list.  Some of the developers frequent the #harfbuzz channel on freenode IRC server.  If you write to the mailing list, you are guaranteed to get an answer.  The same is not necessarily true about the IRC channel.

To report bugs or submit patches, you can either use [[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=HarfBuzz|bugzilla]], or the mailing list.  Bugzilla is preferred, since we can track the issue until it's fixed.

For a comparison of old vs new HarfBuzz memory consumption see [[http://goo.gl/woyty|this]].

If your application uses ICU Layout library, there is a replacement library[[https://github.com/behdad/icu-le-hb|here]] that uses HarfBuzz to provide the same API.  If you try to use it, please report your experience to our mailing list.
