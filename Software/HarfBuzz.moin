HarfBuzz is an [[http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/|OpenType]] text shaping engine.  There are two HarfBuzz code trees in existence today:

 * The current HarfBuzz tree, also known as harfbuzz-ng, is under active development and is what is used in Firefox 4.  It is available [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/|here]].

 * The old HarfBuzz tree, derived from [[http://freetype.org/|FreeType]], [[http://pango.org/|Pango]], and [[http://www.trolltech.com/|Qt]], is available [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz.old/|here]].  It is not actively developed or maintained.  All users are encouraged to switch over to the new HarfBuzz.

For a comparison of old vs new HarfBuzz memory consumption see [[http://goo.gl/woyty|this]].


=== Background ===

To get a better idea of where HarfBuzz stands in the text rendering stack you may want to read [[http://behdad.org/text/|State of Text Rendering]].  For an intro to the ongoing API design issues with the new HarfBuzz see [[http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2009-August/000359.html|this thread]], although note that the thread is from August 2009, and all of the issues raised there have been resolved already.

For tarball releases of the new HarfBuzz codebase, look [[http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/|here]].  The API is not expected to change incompatibly, but we cannot guarantee that until HarfBuzz 1.0.0 is released.

There are no tarball releases of the old HarfBuzz codebase available.  If you want to use the old HarfBuzz, just import it into your project.
