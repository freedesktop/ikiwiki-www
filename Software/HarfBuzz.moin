== HarfBuzz ==

HarfBuzz is an [http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/ OpenType] Layout engine.  The current code was originally derived from the [http://freetype.org/ FreeType] project, developed separately in [http://pango.org/ Pango] and [http://www.trolltech.com/ Qt], and finally merged back into a common repository as part of this project.

The code has evolved from its original form, has got various improvements and bugs fixed, and has got a glyph-buffer data structure that can be used as a highlevel interface to the layout engine.

== Download ==

There are no releases available for download yet, and currently there are no releases scheduled, as the main audience of the code is developers of text rendering engines and currently the recommended way to use the code is to copy it into your project.  Use CVS to check out the latest version instead, but please keep a note of your checkout date in your project, that will help with tracking bugs later.
