HarfBuzz is an [[http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/|OpenType]] text shaping engine.

There are two HarfBuzz code trees in existence today:

The new HarfBuzz tree, also known as harfbuzz-ng, is under active development and is what is used in Firefox 4.  It is available [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/|here]].

The old HarfBuzz tree, derived from [[http://freetype.org/|FreeType]], [[http://pango.org/|Pango]], and [[http://www.trolltech.com/|Qt]], is available [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz.old/|here]].  It is in maintenance mode and not actively developed.  We expect users of this code base to start moving to harfbuzz-ng soon.


=== Background ===

To get a better idea of where HarfBuzz stands in the text rendering stack you may want to read [[http://behdad.org/text/|State of Text Rendering]].  For an intro to the ongoing API design issues with the new HarfBuzz see [[http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2009-August/000359.html|this thread]], although note that the thread is from August 2009, and most of the issues raised there have been resolved already.
