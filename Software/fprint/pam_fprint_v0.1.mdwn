[[pam_fprint|Software/fprint/pam_fprint]] v0.1 was released on 15th November 2007. It is the initial public release designed to run against [[libfprint v0.0.1|Software/fprint/libfprint v0.0.1]]. 

**This is a proof-of-concept module** and might not work well in some environments (such as a graphical login manager). I have only tested it against text mode unix login (shadow). 

Be aware that [[libfprint|Software/fprint/libfprint]] does not guarantee a stable ABI. So, pam_fprint may break if you upgrade libfprint in future without recompiling pam_fprint. 

You must enroll a finger before you can use pam_fprint. Currently the only easy way to do this is to use the `enroll` example from libfprint.
