[[fprint_demo|Software/fprint/fprint_demo]] v0.1 was released on 17th November 2007. It is the initial release designed to run against [[libfprint v0.0.2|Software/fprint/libfprint v0.0.2]]. 

This app is for demonstration and to assist in development (e.g. helps evaluate image quality). It's a little quirky and not complete (there's a TODO list in the README file). Right now it only offers verification against a previously-enrolled fingerprint. 

Be aware that [[libfprint|Software/fprint/libfprint]] does not guarantee a stable ABI. So, fprint_demo may break if you upgrade libfprint in future without recompiling fprint_demo. 

You must enroll a finger before you can use fprint_demo. Currently the only easy way to do this is to use the `enroll` example from libfprint.
