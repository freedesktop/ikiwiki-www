We use a public mailing list for user support and project development. You must subscribe to the list before you can post there. After subscribing, you can just write emails to fprint@lists.freedesktop.org.

 * [[http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/fprint|Subscription and list information]]
 * [[http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fprint/|List archives]]
 * [[http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.fprint|List archives at GMANE]]
 * [[http://www.mail-archive.com/fprint@reactivated.net/|List archives at mail-archive.com]]

Please use the mailing list rather than mailing developers directly, unless you have good reasons.

When responding to mails on this list, please use the reply-to-all feature of your mail client. This way, the person who sent the original email (who may have disabled mail delivery on the mailing list settings) receives their own copy of the email, and this list gets one too.

Prior to 23rd May 2011, the fprint list was hosted elsewhere. An archive of the list archives from the original host can be found at http://www.reactivated.net/fprint_list_archives/. The [[http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.fprint|GMANE archives]] maintain an uninterrupted history.
