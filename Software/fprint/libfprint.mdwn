libfprint is an open source software library designed to make it easy for application developers to add support for consumer fingerprint readers to their software. 


### Features

* Written in C 
* Licensed as [[LGPL-2.1|http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html]] 
* Depends on libusb for USB communication and glib 
* Primarily developed for linux, but should be fairly portable 
* **Offers a single API to application developers to access the entire range of supported devices** 
* Supports imaging - downloading live fingerprint scans from the device 
* Includes image processing/matching code 
* Supports enrollment/verification - enrolling a print from a known user, and then later comparing a live scan to the enrolled print

### API documentation

API documentation can be found here: [[http://www.reactivated.net/fprint/api/|http://www.reactivated.net/fprint/api/]] 

It is updated from the source code periodically. To generate your own documentation from the sources, install [[doxygen|http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/]] then, from a libfprint source tree: 
[[!format txt """
 cd doc
 make docs
"""]]
Documentation is then available under the html subdirectory. 


### Development

libfprint is developed using the [[git version control system|http://git.or.cz/]]. The [[git user manual|http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html]] is very useful for new users.
