libfprint is an open source software library designed to make it easy for application developers to add support for consumer fingerprint readers to their software.


### Features

* Written in C
* Licensed as [[LGPL-2.1|http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html]]
* Depends on libusb for USB communication and glib
* Primarily developed for linux, but should be fairly portable
* **Offers a single API to application developers to access the entire range of supported devices**
* Supports imaging - downloading live fingerprint scans from the device
* Includes image processing/matching code
* Supports enrollment/verification - enrolling a print from a known user, and then later comparing a live scan to the enrolled print

### API documentation

API documentation can be found here: [[http://www.reactivated.net/fprint/api/|http://www.reactivated.net/fprint/api/]]

It is updated from the source code periodically. To generate your own documentation from the sources, install [[doxygen|http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/]] then, from a libfprint source tree:

    cd doc
    make docs

Documentation is then available under the html subdirectory.


### Development

libfprint is developed using the [[git version control system|http://git.or.cz/]]. The [[git user manual|http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html]] is very useful for new users.

### Contributing

Bug reports and (git formatted) patches should go to the [[FreeDesktop bugzilla|https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=libfprint]].

See the HACKING file for some information on the code and its design, and TODO for some items that remain to be completed.
