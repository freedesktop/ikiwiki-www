The `upektc` driver supports devices based on the [[UPEK TouchChip chipset|http://www.upek.com/solutions/pc_and_networking/usb_readers.asp]] and [[EikonTouch 300|http://www.authentec.com/Products/TouchChips/USBReaders.aspx]]. 

upektc is part of [[libfprint|Software/fprint/libfprint]] and was developed by Jan-Michael Brummer. 


## Supported Devices

This driver supports the device found in the Samsung P35 laptop, also it supports standalone [[UPEK EikonTouch 300|http://www.authentec.com/Products/TouchChips/USBReaders.aspx]] device. 

This driver does **not** support the UPEK Touch``Strip found in a lot of other laptops. Such hardware is supported by the [[upekts|Software/fprint/libfprint/upekts]] driver instead. 


## Driver history

This driver is an adaption of the code found in [[Jan-Michael Brummer's UPEK TouchChip driver project|http://www.tabos.org/fpm/#FingerPrint]]. These efforts were based on bus traffic analysis from the UPEK Windows driver. Eikon``Touch 300 support was based on [[patch from Moganeshwaran Rajasegaran|https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45197]] 


## Device operation

This is an imaging device that returns greyscale images with 208x288 pixels. 


## Security notes

Fingerprint image data is sent unencrypted over the USB bus. 


## Other capabilities

This hardware has the capability to store fingerprints on the device. libfprint/upektc does not currently offer access to this functionality, but this will change in future. LEDs present in Eikon``Touch 300 are not supported
