This driver supports devices based on the [[SecuGen FDU2000 (aka SecuGen Hamster III) finger scanner|http://www.secugen.com/products/ph.htm]]. 

fdu2000 is part of [[libfprint|Software/fprint/libfprint]] and was originally written by Gustavo Chain, and is now maintained by Davidlohr Bueso. 

**Driver was not ported to asynchronous framework, so it's currently disabled in libfprint. If you're interested in this driver - drop a letter into [[mailing list|Software/fprint/Mailing list]] and we'll try to figure that out**
