[[libfprint|Software/fprint/libfprint]] v0.0.5 was released on 7th December 2007. 

**There is currently NO GUARANTEE of API/ABI or data format stability.** Programs compiled against this release may not work with future releases. Prints enrolled with this release may not work with future releases. We will reach stability in API/ABI/datafmts in time, but not just yet. 

User documentation is still sparse, but the notes under [[libfprint v0.0.1|Software/fprint/libfprint v0.0.1]] are still relevant. [[fprint_demo|Software/fprint/fprint_demo]] is a nice way of exploring the features offered by this library.
