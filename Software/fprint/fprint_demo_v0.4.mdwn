[[fprint_demo|Software/fprint/fprint_demo]] v0.4 was released on 22nd November 2007. It adds identification functionality -- scan any enrolled finger and the application will tell you which finger you scanned. 

Be aware that [[libfprint|Software/fprint/libfprint]] does not guarantee a stable ABI. So, fprint_demo may break if you upgrade libfprint in future without recompiling fprint_demo.
