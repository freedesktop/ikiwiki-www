## Possible Packaging for the traditional X applications

Most, but not all of the applications shipped traditionally have much more modern GUI equivalents. But some do not, or are useful for scripting and still valuable.

### XKB Package (xkbprogs)

Not all X servers support XKB, so the clients should be separate.

### Xt utilities Package (xtutilities)

Lots of people no longer care about Xt; but some still care about Motif a lot. 

Test package available from [[http://freedesktop.org/~markh/xapps/xtutilities|http://freedesktop.org/~markh/xapps/xtutilities]]

### X Traditional Programs Package (xtrad)

### Core Fonts Package (xfontprogs)

It is now possible to live entirely with client side fonts, so it should be possible to punt all the utilities related to them. 
[[!table header="no" class="mointable" data="""
 **Program**  |  **Description**  |  **Comments**

 xfontsel  |  point and click selection of X11 font names  |  
"""]]


### Font Server Package (xfsprogs)

Font servers may be needed in legacy environments, so we can't just forget them. 
[[!table header="no" class="mointable" data="""
 **Program**  |  **Description**  |  **Comments** 
 fslsfonts  |  generate BDF font from X font server  |

 glxinfo  |  display info about a GLX extension and !OpenGL renderer  |  
"""]]


### LBX Package (xlbxprogs)

LBX should be strongly deprecated in favor of ssh, with a reference to the 2003 Usenix performance paper and the terrible security situation. 
[[!table header="no" class="mointable" data="""
 **Program**  |  **Description**  |  **Comments** 
 lbxproxy  |  Low BandWidth X proxy  |  
 xfindproxy  |  locate proxy services  |  
 proxymngr  |  proxy manager service  |  
"""]]


### Redundant Package (xredundant)

Twm, xterm and xdm are commonly replaced by desktop specific components: but there is also a set of low resource systems who use these applications, so claiming they are obsolete is a mistake. But if you were installing either KDE or Gnome, you'd be unlikely to want these applications. 
[[!table header="no" class="mointable" data="""
 **Program**  |  **Description**  |  **Comments** 
 twm  |  Tab Window Manager for the X Window System  |  
 xdm  |  X Display Manager with support for XDMCP, host chooser  |  
 xterm  |  terminal emulator for X   |  
"""]]


### Imake Package
[[!table header="no" class="mointable" data="""
 **Program**  |  **Description**  |  **Comments** 
 imake  |  Imake program  |  Need imake to build existing apps and need it for AC_EXTRAS 
"""]]


### What to do about????

I suspect we should put these into a package, but not normally install the programs, maybe with README's explaining why. 
[[!table header="no" class="mointable" data="""
 **Program**  |  **Description**  |  **Comments** 
 rstart  |  a sample implementation of a Remote Start client  |  deprecated to ssh/sshd 
 scripts  |  start an X program on a remote machine  |  deprecated due to insecurity to ssh/sshd 
 xfwp  |  X Firewall Proxy  |  obsolete in favor of ssh?
