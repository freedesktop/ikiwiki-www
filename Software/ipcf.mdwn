IPCF, the InterPersonal Communication Framework project, was an old name for [Telepathy](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/).

The aim of this project is to provide a framework that unifies all forms of real time conversations, including, but not limited to, instant messaging, IRC and voice and video over IP. It aims to provide an interface to client applications allowing them to implement, in a minimal number of lines of code, real time communication over any implemented protocol.
