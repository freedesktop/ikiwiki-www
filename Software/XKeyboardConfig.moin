= X Keyboard Configuration Database =

The non-arch keyboard configuration database for X Window. The goal is to provide the consistent, well-structured, frequently released open source of X keyboard configuration data for X Window System implementations (free, open source and commercial). The project is targeted to XKB-based systems.

= What is it for? =

There are many X Window implementations which have very poor support for non-standard keyboards, national layouts and options. 

Open Source X Window System implementations (xfree86, x.org) currently have non-synchronized XKB configuration databases: the bugs fixed in one repository are not reflected in the other, new configuration elements are added (in best case) separately and independently to both CVS trees - but usually only one tree gets them. Also, these implementations contain unbalanced and unstructured layout trees (very often one country/language have several layouts, each with its own set of variants).

Commercial X Window System implementations cannot support large variety of national layouts - usually, because of lack of resources. So users from "exotic" countries feel offended and frustrated - their environments are not complete.

The solution which would guarantee quality support for the keyboard configuration data is to have single repository which would serve as meta-project for X servers and OS distributions. X Keyboard Configuration Database is trying to be the one.

= Releases =

	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/xkeyboard-config-0.1.tar.gz|0.1]] - 25 May 2004, first version.  Only single-group layouts are included (tested for compatibility with the multiple layouts feature). Each language/country has no more than one layout and any number of variants.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/xkeyboard-config-0.2.tar.gz|0.2]] - 12 Jun 2004, second version. HOWTO.transition is added, xkbcomp symlink is supported, Maori layout is added, small fix for Brasilian layout is applied.  
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/xkeyboard-config-0.3.tar.gz|0.3]] - 23 Jul 2004, HEAVILY restructured layout names, compatibility rules are introduced, intltool problem resolved (sorry, with warnings).
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/xkeyboard-config-0.4.tar.gz|0.4]] - 28 Sep 2004, A lot of fixes. More univeral EURO handling. New urdu layout. Improved handling for indicators.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.5.tar.gz|0.5]] - 02 Mar 2005, New layouts/models/options. Updated translations. Group names synchronization.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.6.tar.gz|0.6]] - August 2005, Many improvements.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.7.tar.bz2|0.7]] - December 2005, New layouts/models/options. Reogranized symbols/inet.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.8.tar.bz2|0.8]] - March 2006, New layouts, fixes.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.9.tar.bz2|0.9]] - October 2006, New layouts, fixes.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-1.0.tar.bz2|1.0]] - July 2007, Around 70 bugs from freedesktop.org bugzilla were fixed.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-1.1.tar.bz2|1.1]] - September 2007, Around 30 bugs from freedesktop.org bugzilla were fixed. First time-based release.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-1.2.tar.bz2|1.2]] - January 2008, Around 40 bugs from freedesktop.org bugzilla were fixed. Updated translation schema.
	* [[http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-1.3.tar.bz2|1.3]] - May 2008, Around 40 bugs from freedesktop.org bugzilla were fixed. Dropped old rulesets sgi and sun. Added a lot of metadata, related to countries and languages.

= Contributions to the project. Relations to X Window System implementations. =

We kindly ask and encourage people contributing layouts to XFree86 and
X.Org repositories to send patches to X Keyboard Configuration Database. We would
highly appreciate X implementations using our codebase in their
distributions (there was preliminary agreement with X.Org implementation
maintainers).
