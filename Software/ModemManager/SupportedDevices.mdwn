Supported devices in ModemManager 0.8.x
=========================================

This section provides an overall view of the current support of modems in ModemManager 0.8.x series. This list is by no means complete, modems not listed here may work nicely with ModemManager or may not work at all.

* If your modem *is not* correctly supported by ModemManager, please open a bug in [[Bugzilla|https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?product=modemmanager]] and attach debug logs.
* If your modem *is* properly supported by ModemManager but is not found in the table, send an email to the [[mailing list|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/modemmanager-devel]] along with debug logs

The colors in the rows of the list mean the following:

<table>
 <tr><td style="background-color: #CCFFCC;"> GREEN  </td><td style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Supported and tested </td></tr>
 <tr><td style="background-color: #FFFF99;"> YELLOW </td><td style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Should be supported  </td></tr>
 <tr><td style="background-color: #FF8080;"> RED    </td><td style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Known to be not properly supported yet </td></tr>
</table>

VID and PID are the USB *Vendor ID* and *Product ID* of the device, if applicable.
