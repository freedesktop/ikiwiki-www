== X Developer's Meeting ==

We have scheduled a three day X Developer's meeting from
Saturday, February 12, through Monday, February 14, at the
Cambridge Research Laboratory (CRL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

**** The meeting is now full!!! ***

This meeting is intended to cover a wide variety of topics
about X Window System technologies, and the as yet unmet
needs of the technologies that depend on the X Window System.
As a result, this meeting is intended for people working across
the entire X Window System stack, including toolkits and window
managers and desktop infrastructure.  This meeting is not, however,
intended to cover general X application development topics or
concepts.

There will be a number of people giving presentations or leading discussions.  These
presentations will likely consume no more than half of the overall
meeting time so the remaining time can be spent with informal
discussions, hacking, breakout sessions, etc.

If you wish to volunteer to give a presentation or lead a discussion, please send e-mail
to ["mailto:xdevconf@freedesktop.org xdevconf@freedesktop.org"].
In addition, if you have specific topics you'd like to see discussed in a presentation or during informal sessions, please send e-mail with your suggestions to that address as well.

=== Limited In-Person Attendance ===
Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to no more than
40 people, and we are almost full. If you would like to attend, please send mail to
["mailto:xdevconf@freedesktop.org xdevconf@freedesktop.org"].
Having the names of attendees in advance eases building security,
as we share the building with other companies.

An audio feed will be made available for those attending remotely
or unable to attend due to limitations on space. The meeting venue
provides networking support with high speed Internet access.

The hotels recommended near CRL are The Kendall Hotel, the Cambridge
Marriott, and the Residence Inn.  All three of these are a short
walk from CRL and easily accessible via public transportation from
the Kendall Square subway stop next to MIT.  We have not negotiated
any special rates with these hotels, so you'll need to shop around
for the best rates, as they vary. A longer list of hotels
is available at http://www.ai.mit.edu/visiting/hotels/hotels.shtml .
