I've also listed the missing requirements for [[Voice over LTE (VoLTE)|Software/Farstream/LTE Requirements]] and [[rtcweb|Software/Farstream/RtcWeb Requirements]]. 

Voice over LTE (VoLTE) has [[extra requirements|Software/Farstream/LTE Requirements]]. WebRTc 


### RTP plugin

* Add an "extra-send-codecs" property to [[FsSession|FsSession]] and add it to the "farsight-send-codec-changed" message 
* RTP/RTCP multiplexing/demultiplexing (to send both on the same UDP port) 
* Comfort noise (write Free software VAD and CN generator) 
* Add REDundant audio data (RFC 2198) 
* Support multiple stun servers in the rawudp plugin and possibly also libnice 
* Document 
   * That you have to be playing for most stuff to happen (like getting stun replies) 
* Re-write codec discovery 
   * Make it possible to use the missing-element message to ask the user to install extra codecs, so keep list of pay/depay without enc/dec 
   * Make it possible to specify input/output caps so we can send pre-encoded data, etc 
   * Make the codec cleaner and hopefully remove the h263/amr hacks 
* SRTP support is in gst-plugins-bad using libsrtp. The Farstream API and integration needs to be done 

#### Tests to write

* Two sessions in the same conference 
* Packets with invalid payload types 
* Setting invalid payload types as local or remote codecs (in the 35-96 range). 
* Errors: 
   * New stream with invalid participant (invalid... from another type or from 
         * another conf?) 
* Change codec ids while its running... 
* New codec with the same PT while its running 
* H263-1998 (use h263 or h263+ encoder depending on the properties) 
* 3 way negotiation 
   * success 
   * failed 
* Test codec cache: 
   * empty 
   * save 
   * load 
* Test non-rtcp case (drop rtcp, filter candidate, provide wrong candidate?) 
   * Test lack of rtcp with more than one participant (it should fail) 
* Change the udp port of a stream while it's running (rawudp transmitter, multicast transmitter?) 
* Generate DTMF 
   * Sound (write dtmf detector?) 
* Receive DTMF 
   * Events (without dtmf detector? only check if [[GstMessages|GstMessages]] are received maybe?) 
* Changing a running pipeline 
   * Add a session to a running pipeline 
   * Destroy a session in a running pipeline 
   * Re-add a destroying session in a running pipline 
* Write automated tests for the live adder 
* Set to playing more than once? 

### Other plugins

Port msnav, yahoowebcam to the new api 


### Generic GStreamer RTP enhancements

* Make reverse propagation of SDP optional parameters to the encoders 
   * Speex 
   * H263 
   * H264
