== Possible Packaging for the traditional X applications ==

Most, but not all of the applications shipped traditionally have much more modern GUI equivalents. But some do not, or are useful for scripting and still valuable.

| lbxproxy | Low !BandWidth X proxy | |

=== Redundant Package (xredundant) ===

Twm, xterm and xdm are commonly replaced by desktop specific components: but there is also a set of low resource systems who use these applications, so claiming they are obsolete is a mistake.
But if you were installing either KDE or Gnome, you'd be unlikely to want these applications.

| *Program* | *Description* | *Comments* |
| twm | Tab Window Manager for the X Window System | |
| xdm | X Display Manager with support for XDMCP, host chooser | |
| xterm | terminal emulator for X  | |

=== What to do about???? ===

I suspect we should put these into a package, but not normally install
the programs, maybe with README's explaining why.
| *Program* | *Description* | *Comments* |
| rstart | a sample implementation of a Remote Start client | deprecated to ssh/sshd |
| scripts | start an X program on a remote machine | deprecated due to insecurity to ssh/sshd |
