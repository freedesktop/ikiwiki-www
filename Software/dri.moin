where is the content of http://www.freedesktop.org/~dri/snapshots/  ?

Snapshots are currently not available. The old snapshots were potentially compromised and we have no way of verifying them. New snapshots will be available at a new location soon, probably http://dri.freedesktop.org/snapshots. If you're really desparate check out http://freedesktop.org/~fxkuehl/snapshots in the mean while for unofficial snapshots.
