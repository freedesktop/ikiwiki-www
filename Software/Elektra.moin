= About =

Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration
parameters in a hierarchical key-value pair mechanism, instead of each program
using its own text configuration files. This allows any program to read and
save its configuration with a consistent API, and allows them to be aware of
other applications' configurations, permitting easy application integration.
