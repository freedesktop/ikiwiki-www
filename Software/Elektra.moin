= About =

Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration
parameters in a global, hierarchical key database.  The core is a small
library implemented in C. The plugin-based framework fulfills many
configuration-related tasks to avoid any unnecessary code duplication
across applications while it still allows the core to stay without any
external dependency. Elektra abstracts from cross-platform-related issues
with an consistent API, and allows applications to be aware of other
applications' configurations, leveraging easy application integration.
