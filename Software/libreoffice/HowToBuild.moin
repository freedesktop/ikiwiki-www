On my Ubuntu Lucid, I had to get:
{{{
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/libreoffice/build

apt-get build-dep openoffice.org
apt-get install junit4 libgnomevfs2-dev

./autogen.sh --with-distro=LibreOfficeLinux --with-git --with-num-cpus=2
./download
make
}}}
and I (had to) run the ./autogen command with --disable-kde --disable-kde4 because I am not interested in the qt frontend (and would get some errors about missing qt headers when I actually had them installed).
