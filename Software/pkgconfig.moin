== pkg-config ==

pkg-config is a system for managing library compile/link flags that works with automake and autoconf. It replaces the ubiquitous *-config scripts you may have seen with a single tool. There's nothing desktop-specific or desktop-related about pkg-config, despite it being on freedesktop.org.

The pkg-config web page has been moved to [[http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/]].
