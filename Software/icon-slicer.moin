icon-slicer is a utility for generating icon themes and libXcursor cursor themes.

The inputs to icon-slicer are conceptually: 
	1 A set of multi-layer images, one for each size.
	2 A XML theme description file

Each image contains all the cursors arranged in a grid; For cursors the layers are: 
	* A layer with a dot for the hotspot of each cursor
	* The main image or first animation frame for multi-frame animated cursors
	* The second animation frame for multi-frame animated cursors
	* ...

For icons, the layers are: 
	* A layer with the images
	* An optional layer with attachment points for emblems
	* An optional layer with boxes for embedding text into icons.

In practice, since loading of multilayer images is not supported by standard image libraries, each layer is input as a separate image file. 

The theme description file contains, among other things, information about the source images to read, the location of each named cursor or icon within the grid, and a set of aliases from names to other names.
