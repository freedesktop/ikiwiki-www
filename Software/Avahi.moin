Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network -- this means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being shared.  This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf') and is very convenient.

Avahi is based on LennartPoettering's flexmdns mDNS implemenation for Linux which has been discontinued in favour of Avahi.

== Details ==
Avahi implements the [http://www.dns-sd.org/ DNS-SD] over [http://www.multicastdns.org/ Multicast DNS].  It uses [http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus D-BUS] to communicate from the application to the system daemon.  A system daemon is used to coordinate application efforts in caching replies, necessary to reduce noise on networks generated by protocols such as MDNS.  The goals of this project are for implementation into the GNOME desktop, however that does not stop it from being used by any other applications or desktop environments as long as you have a working installation of dbus, which most modern distributions now come with by default.

== Why ==
Although other implementations exist (such as Howl), none exist that use fully open and free GPL-compatible code.  The howl library is hindered by the APSL among other things, which makes it undesirable to some people, especially distributions such as Debian which has strict free software guidelines.

== Current Status ==
The Avahi mDNS responder is now feature complete implementing all MUSTs and the majority of the SHOULDs of the mDNS RFC. It passes all (except a questionable one) tests in the Apple Bonjour conformance test suite. In addition it supports some nifty things that have never been seen elsewhere like correct mDNS reflection accross LAN segments. The mDNS responder is implemented as a C library ("avahi-core") which is embeddable into other applications. The daemon itself including a DBUS API is complete, as well as a C client wrapper around this API.

== FAQ ==
 * '''Is it OK to run multiple mDNS responders on the same machine?''' No, it is not OK. Sooner or later some mDNS features known as "Known Answer Suppression" and "Unicast Reply" (and probably some more) will result in problems if more than one responder runs on the same machine.
 * '''May I enable the mDNS reflector on multiple hosts accessing the same two networks?''' No, don't do that. Queries will be looped, and sooner or later your network will be stalled with mDNS traffic.
 * '''Avahi doesn't work, it doesn't register or find any services and doesn't resolve mDNS host names!''' Make sure:
  * That you run a recent Kernel (both 2.4 and 2.6 should work) with IP Multicasting enabled
  * That you run only one mDNS stack 
  * That you disabled all local firewalls (This includes disabling the Firestarter default FW), at least for UDP traffic from and to port 5353
 * '''Does avahi run on non-Linux operating systems?''' Avahi 0.5.2 runs on Linux only, however Avahi SVN (targetted to 0.6) now has a preliminary, working port to FreeBSD, NetBSD and Darwin (MacOSX), and Solaris is currently being worked on.
 * '''Blah, you fools, glib is bloat and sucks!''' Avahi doesn't depend on glib. Yet it comes with a glib event loop adapter. Use --disable-gtk to disable building it.
 * '''Blah, you fools, DBUS is bloat and sucks!''' Then Avahi is not for you, sorry. As it seems we think a little different about DBUS than you do.
 * '''Why did you implement yet another free mDNS stack? Apple released their code under a free license!''' The "freeness" of the license Apple used is questionnable, e.g. the Debian project decided to not include code under APSL. In addition we consider our code superior to Apple's in many aspects. In case you want to flame us on this topic, our email address is /dev/null.
 * '''Will Avahi work with a GUI and/or X/GNOME/KDE?''' - Yes, while Avahi is most often usefull in a GUI with some kind of program, actual use of its libraries are in no way tied to X, GNOME, KDE or any other kind of GUI.  The screenshot we show here is simply of a tool which displays services on the network (It's really just a demonstration).  One example is that you can use the static service files (/etc/avahi/services/) to advertise some services on a head-less machine, e.g. a WEB or FTP server.

== Architectural Overview ==

avahi consists of several parts:

 * '''libavahi-common''' - a library containing some function used both by clients to the avahi-daemon and the mDNS stack itself.
 * '''libavahi-core''' - A library implementing a flexible mDNS/DNS-SD stack. The most prominent consumer is avahi-daemon. Besides that primarily useful for developers of embedded applications. This stack is very avanced and has some uncommon features like mDNS reflection. A preliminary (doxygen generated) API documentation for this and libavahi-common is [http://www.freedesktop.org/~lennart/doxygen/ available.]
 * '''libavahi-client''' - A minimal wrapper around the DBUS API to simplify its usage. Hides the DBUS internals completely. This resembles the API of libavahi-core more or less.
 * '''libavahi-glib''' - An adapter for connection avahi-client or avahi-core to a GLib main loop.
 * '''libavahi-qt''' - Adapter connecting to Qt 3 or Qt 4 core main loop (two separate versions can be built)
 * '''avahi-discover-standalone''' - A GTK tool for enumerating all available services on the local LAN. Its links directly against libavahi-core, i.e. embedds its own mDNS stack. You should use it only for debugging, since it's not a good idea to run multiple mDNS stacks simultaneously on the same machine. (Screenshot above)
 * '''avahi-daemon''' - The avahi daemon which makes use of libavahi-core to implement an mDNS stack which is accessible by different ways:
  * System administrators may put short XML fragments in /etc/avahi/services to publish semi-static services (e.g. SSH)
  * A so called "simple protocol" whith a very limited command set which is used exclusively by nss-mdns (to resolve host names via mDNS) and avahi-dnsconfd
  * The DBUS interface for normal clients (like nautilus or gaim) which is an IPC wrapper around the functions provided by libavahi-core 
 * '''[http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/ nss-mdns]''' - A GNU libc NSS module for host name resolving using mDNS. This is an external project maintained by Lennart and not part of avahi since it doesn't require avahi to be useful. But if it finds a running avahi daemon it makes use of its superior RR cacheing.
 * '''avahi-dnsconfd''' - A small daemon which may be used to configure conventional DNS servers using mDNS in a DHCP-like fashion. Especially useful on IPv6.
 * '''avahi-browse''', '''avahi-publish-service''', '''avahi-publish-address''', '''avahi-resolve-address''', '''avahi-resolve-host-name''' - Some command line utilities written in Python which use the DBUS API to take care of simple tasks.
 * '''avahi-discover''' - An implementation of an '''avahi-discover-standalone'''-like tool, but written in Python using pygtk and using DBUS to communicate with an Avahi daemon.
 * '''avahi-bookmarks''' - A Python based miniature web server that browses for mDNS/DNS-SD services of type '_http._tcp' (i.e. web sites) and makes them available as HTML links on http://localhost:8080.

Please have a look on [http://freedesktop.org/~lennart/overview.png this graphic] which illustrates a little how these parts play together. (The white rectangles are implemented by Avahi, the gray rectangles are external components)
