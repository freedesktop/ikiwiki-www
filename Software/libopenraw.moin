libopenraw is an ongoing project to provide a free software implementation for camera RAW files decoding. One of the main reason is that [http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/ dcraw] is not suited for easy integrate into applications, and there is a need for an easy to use API to build free software digital image processing application.

It also has the goal to address missing feature from [http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/  dcraw] like meta-data decoding and easy thumbnail extraction.
