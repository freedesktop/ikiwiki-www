pkg-config is a helper tool used when compiling applications and libraries.  It helps you insert the correct compiler options on the command line so an application can use {{{ gcc -o test test.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0` }}} for instance, rather than hard-coding values on where to find glib (or other libraries).  It is language-agnostic, so it can be used for defining the location of documentation tools, for instance.

The program is free software and licensed under the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html|GPL]] version 2 or any later version (at your option).

pkg-config works on multiple platforms: Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, Mac OS X and Windows.  It does not require anything but a reasonably well working C compiler and a C library, but can use an installed glib if that is present.  (A copy of glib 1.2.10 is shipped together with pkg-config and this is sufficient for pkg-config to compile and work properly.)

The first implementation was written in shell, by James Henstridge.  Later, it was rewritten in C by Havoc Pennington.  It also grew an autoconf macro written by Tim Janik, later rewritten by Scott James Remnant.  The current maintainer is [[mailto:tfheen@err.no|Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@err.no>]].

The current release of pkg-config is version 0.26 and can be found in [[http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/|/releases]].

pkg-config is available from the [[http://git-scm.com/|git]] repository at git://anongit.freedesktop.org/pkg-config
