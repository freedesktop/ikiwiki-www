= Translators =

We need translators: for the software itself (!LibreOffice), and also for our web infrastructure, such as this wiki, and the main website at [[http://documentfoundation.org]]. If you are interested in helping us translate, please be patient. We need your help, but right now, we are still trying to set up our infrastructure to make your job as easy as possible.

We provide l10n specific mailing lists for the start. Please subscribe via

l10n+subscribe@libreoffice.org

l10n+subscribe-digest@libreoffice.org

We might need some minor string changes for 3.3 release - see the [[Software/LibreOffice/i18n/translating_3.3|suggested process]].

== Infrastructure ==

We currently host a [[http://translations.documentfoundation.org/pootle/|translation server]]. You may register an account at this server, but need to ask for further permissions at the l10n@libreoffice.org mailing list or at your [[http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Language_Teams|Language Team]].
