# MiracleCast - libwfd

**libwfd** provides a stand-alone implementation of the Wifi-Display protocol. It is developed as part of MiracleCast, but doesn't have any of its heavy dependencies. You can use it to implement your own Miracast stack or for external helper programs.

The repository is available on [freedesktop.org](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~dvdhrm/libwfd).
