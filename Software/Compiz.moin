== What is Compiz? ==

Compiz is a compositing window manager that uses 3D graphics acceleration via OpenGL. It provides various new graphical effects and features on any desktop environment, including GNOME and KDE. 

Compiz has a flexible plug-in system and it is designed to run well on most graphics hardware.

The implementation of Compiz is based on using the new GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension of Xgl, AIGLX or NVIDIA for binding redirected top-level windows to texture objects.
