# Suggested Fontconfig font substitutions

Poppler is using fontconfig (unless built with the win32 font configuration option) to do the font searching on the system for fonts that are not embedded into the pdf files. This is a list of recommended font substitutions that distributions/users should have in their fontconfig configuration

    Font A -> Font B
    Symbol -> Standard Symbols L
    ZapfDingbats -> Dingbats
    
To do the substitution use

    <alias>
        <family>Font A</family>
        <accept><family>Font B</family></accept>
    </alias>
    
If that does not work for you use
    
    <match target="pattern">
     <test name="family">
      <string>Font A</string>
     </test>
     <edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="same">
      <string>Font B</string>
     </edit>
    </match>
    
but what you should do is warn your distribution to improve their default fontconfig configuration

Both fonts come in the Free Type1 URW fonts package and is very probable distributions already ship it.
