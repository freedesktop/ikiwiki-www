== X Server ==

The X server project holds sources to build an X server separately from a full X distribution.  The only drivers supplied are based on the kdrive framework.

=== Translucent windows ===

Translucent windows are not an intrinsic element of recent X server development, rather they come from a combination of many separate projects working together.  Take a look at [http://freedesktop.org/~keithp/screenshots Keith's Screenshots] and then read a more detailed [wiki:Software/TranslucentWindows article on how translucent windows work]

The xcompmgr utility in xapps CVS is a sample compositing manager.  You can enable client-side shadows with -c or server-side shadows with -s.  There is also the transset utility to set the transparency of windows as a whole.

=== Installation ===

There is a rough guide for installing the Kdrive X Servers from CVS in the /InstallGuide.

=== The todo list ===

There's a list of non-strategic development tasks that are either under way or need help
in the /ToDoList.

=== CVS ===

Use your pdx.freedesktop.org shell account to access /cvs/xserver with ssh, or use anonymous CVS:

{{{
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/xserver login
CVS password: <hit return>
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/xserver co xserver
}}}

Browse CVS with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/xserver/xserver/ View CVS].

=== Mailing Lists ===

The [http://www.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg] mailinglist is the place for discussion of the X Server.

The [http://www.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xserver-commit xserver-commit] mailinglist archives commits to the X Server.
