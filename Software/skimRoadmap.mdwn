## Roadmap for skim


### skim 1.1

                     * Split IMEngine specific config plugins into their corresponding packages (such as scim-chinese); 
                     * Better hierarchy support of config plugins in configure dialog; 

### skim 1.2

                     * Full setup UI for scim-table; 

### skim 1.5

                     * GUI for editing user-defined phrases; 
                     * GUI for creating user-defined table-based input method (as the one shipped with Windows). 

### after Qt4/KDE4

                     * mouse support in inputwindow (lookuptable); 
                     * full setup ui for generic table IMEngine. 

### skim Future

                     * Generic soft keyboard. 

### Other (mainly about art design)

                     * New appearance; 
                     * New icon set. 
I have little idea about art design, so if you are good at this field and willing to give a hand, please offer it in our [[mailing list|http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/scim]] or write directly to the [[mailto:liuspider''ZAI''users.sourceforge.net author|mailto:liuspider''ZAI''users.sourceforge.net author]], thanks.
