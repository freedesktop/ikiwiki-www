# Todo

                     * Add compatibility rules for old broken layouts (to allow users to work with existing configurations) 
                     * Provide more documentation on layouts submission 
                     * Add more and more configuration elements as necessary 
                     * Improve i18n (translation of base.xml file) 

# Submission rules

There are certain rules in the project. These rules are applied to all contributed layouts/variants/models/option. These rules are simple to follow. The code which does not follow them is rejected (or the author is asked to fix the issues). The rules are listed [[here|Software/XKeyboardConfig/Rules]]
