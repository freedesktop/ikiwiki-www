= Release schedule principles =
1. Releases are made every 4 months

2. Two weeks before release, there is a freeze on ''rules'' directory:
  i. ''rules/base.xml.in'' is stable for translators to work
  i. ''rules/base'' is stable, since rules are the most sensitive part of the build
3. The release is performed on last Tuesday of the month.
