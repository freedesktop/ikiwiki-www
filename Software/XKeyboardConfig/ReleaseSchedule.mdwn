# Release schedule principles

1. Releases are made every 4 months 

2. Two weeks before release, there is a freeze on _rules_ directory: 

   1. _rules/base.xml.in_ is stable for translators to work 
   1. _rules/base_ is stable, since rules are the most sensitive part of the build 
3. The release is performed on last Tuesday of the month.
