## xfullscreen

xfullscreen is a simple C module for applications or window managers to determine useful information for fullscreen modes, compensating for dual-head configurations (with or without XINERAMA support), as well as compensating for the current virtual desktop resolution using the XFree86-[[VidMode|VidMode]] extension.  This module provides an easy way to determine the appropriate position and size of the fullscreen window as well as the current pixel aspect ratio.
