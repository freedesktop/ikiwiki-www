This is a short tutorial about how to contribute to the fonts.

== 0. Get ready ==

 1. I really recommend to do the development on a native Linux system, because all necessary tools come already with most distributions. It doesn't really matter which distribution you use (I personally use Debian Etch and Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron), as long as it is fairly recent.
 1. The fonts are produced using [http://fontforge.sf.net Fontforge] a superb open source font editor. Get a recent copy of it (from 2008-03-30 or later) and install it on your development machine. As the fonts we work on are fairly large in size and therefor use a lot of memory when opened in Fontforge, I recommend to have at least 1GB of RAM.
 1. Get the development tarball of the fonts (they are already in fontforge's native sfd format): http://people.ubuntu.com/~arne/cjk-unifonts/uming_ukai_sfd.tar.bz2 (55MB)
 1. Untar them into your working directory: ''tar xvfj uming_ukai_sfd.tar.bz2''
 1. Never modify the original sfd files in place! Use the templates instead: http://people.ubuntu.com/~arne/cjk-unifonts/uming/umingTPL.sfd and http://people.ubuntu.com/~arne/cjk-unifonts/ukai/ukaiTPL.sfd
 1. As the UMing and Ukai fonts are based on the original free Arphic fonts, it's a good idea to have them on the system, too. (On Debian / Ubuntu use ''apt-get install ttf-arphic-bsmi00lp ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp'' (for the Ming/Song style fonts) and ''apt-get install ttf-arphic-bkai00mp ttf-arphic-gkai00mp'' (for the Kai style fonts). You will find the ttf files in ''/usr/share/fonts/truetype/arphic/''. With other distributions the font packages might have different names.)
 1. Get agrep. It allows you to grep a text file with an AND search. (On Debian / Ubuntu: ''apt-get install agrep'')
 1. One very handy text file, which lists all unique Han characters in Unicode 5.0, their radicals, radical index and remaining strokes and components they are built of in IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence) format: [http://people.ubuntu.com/~arne/cjk-unifonts/ids_rs.tar.gz ids_rs.tar.gz] (tarball) or [http://people.ubuntu.com/~arne/cjk-unifonts/ids_rs.zip ids_rs.zip] (zipfile)
 1. Untar the text file in your working directory: ''tar xvfz ids_rs.tar.gz''
 1. Han characters can have different glyph shapes, depending on the region they are used in. Glyphs usually look different in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, even if they share the same codepoint. PDF files, which show these different shapes for each codepoint in the Unicode '''CJK Unified Ideographs''' and '''CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A''' blocks are available here: [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c039921_ISO_IEC_10646_2003(E).zip] (Please note that the glyph shapes have been submitted to Unicode some time ago. Japan has revised some glyph shapes in its latest JIS X0213-2004 standard.)
