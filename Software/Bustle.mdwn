## Bustle <small>– someone's favourite D-Bus profiler</small>

<img src='https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Bustle/bustle-0.5.2-1.png' width='800' height='450' alt="Bustle 0.5.2 showing some D-Bus traffic" align=right>

Bustle is a better `dbus-monitor`. It records and draws sequence diagrams of
[D-Bus](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/) activity, showing signal emissions,
method calls and their corresponding returns, with timestamps for each
individual event and the duration of each method call. This can help you check
for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your D-Bus-based application isn't
performing as well as you like. It also provides statistics like signal
frequencies and average method call times.

### Download

* The easiest way to install Bustle is from [**Flathub**](https://flathub.org/)
* [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/bustle),
  [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/bustle),
  [Gentoo](https://packages.gentoo.org/package/dev-util/bustle),
  or your favourite distribution may have a package
* Source code for releases is [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/bustle/?C=M;O=D)
  or on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bustle)
* [Release notes](https://wjt.github.io/bustle/NEWS.html)

### Using Bustle

With luck, Bustle itself should be self-explanatory: run it, click the button
to record some D-Bus traffic, explore it, save or export the log.

If you want to record traffic without running the UI (maybe on an embedded
platform which doesn't have Gtk+ and/or a Haskell compiler), you can use the
stand-alone logger, which is just a C program:

    bustle-pcap logfile.bustle

You can then open `logfile.bustle` in Bustle.

You can also get some ASCII-art
version of the statistics shown in the UI:

    bustle --count logfile.bustle
    bustle --time logfile.bustle

#### Integration with other tools

* [DBus Test Runner](https://launchpad.net/dbus-test-runner) has built-in support for recording a Bustle log of your tests' D-Bus traffic.

#### Logging System Bus Traffic

If you want to log all system bus traffic, you need to edit
`/etc/dbus/system.conf` to enable eavesdropping, and then remove the include of
`/etc/dbus-1/system.conf.d` which seems to re-enable strictness. Then you can run
the stand-alone logger against the system bus:

    bustle-pcap --system system-log.bustle

Please remember to **undo these changes** when you're done.

### Development


The canonical Git repository is at
[cgit.freedesktop.org](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/bustle/) with a mirror on
[GitHub](https://github.com/wjt/bustle).

Please [report bugs][report] on
[bugs.freedesktop.org](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Bustle), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/wjt/bustle/issues) as you prefer.

You will need a C compiler, a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) compiler and
many libraries. Try:

    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install alex happy gtk2hs-buildtools
    cabal install

To just build the C-only `bustle-pcap` logger, run `make`.

In new code, try to follow [this Haskell style
guide](https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide/blob/master/haskell-style.md).

Patches gratefully accepted, whether [attached to bug reports][report], [submitted as GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/wjt/bustle/pulls), or
[emailed to the maintainer](mailto:will@willthompson.co.uk).
