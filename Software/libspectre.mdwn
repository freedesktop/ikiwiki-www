## What is libspectre

libspectre is a small library for rendering Postscript documents. It provides a convenient easy to use API for handling and rendering Postscript documents.                                                                                                                                         

libspectre it's known to work on UNIX/Linux systems although supporting other platforms (win32, macos) is planned too. Any help on this is, of course, more than welcome :-)
