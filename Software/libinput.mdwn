# libinput

libinput is a library to handle input devices in [Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org) compositors and to provide a generic [X.Org](http://x.org) input driver. It provides device detection, device handling, input device event processing and abstraction so minimize the amount of custom input code compositors need to provide the common set of functionality that users expect.

This wiki page provides high-level information, documentation about libinput's API and examples are available in the [API documentation](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/)
