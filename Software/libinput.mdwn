# libinput

libinput is a library to handle input devices in [Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org) compositors and to provide a generic [X.Org](http://x.org) input driver. It provides device detection, device handling, input device event processing and abstraction so minimize the amount of custom input code compositors need to provide the common set of functionality that users expect.

This wiki page provides high-level information, documentation about libinput's API and examples are available in the [API documentation](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/).

# X.Org libinput driver

The X.Org libinput driver is a thin wrapper around libinput and allows for
libinput to be used for input devices in X. This driver can be used as as drop-in replacement for evdev and synaptics. Simply build and install in your $PREFIX, then install the [config file](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-input-libinput/tree/conf/99-libinput.conf) in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/. Restart X and the libinput driver will take over your devices.
