# AccountsService

AccountsService is a D-Bus service for accessing the list of user accounts and information attached to those accounts. 

AccountsService has been developed in and is used by the GNOME project but should be usable in other desktops.  It is a young project and is being kept pliable to update to requirements as they arise.  See also [[SSSD|https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/]] which may replace / absorb AccountsService in the future.

Documentation for the D-Bus interfaces is included in the source tarball.  See the [[GNOME3 proposal|http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2010-October/msg00132.html]] for more information.
