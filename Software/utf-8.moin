== Project UTF-8 ==

Project UTF-8âs purpose is to document and promote proper Unicode support (particularly UTF-8 support) in free and Open Source software.

The latest specification for UTF-8, dated 2003-11, can be found as IETFâs STD 63 or [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3629.html RFC 3629].

==== Discussion ====

There is a mailing list: utf-8@lists.freedesktop.org. To join the list, send a message to utf-8-request@lists.freedesktop.org with only the word âsubscribeâ in the body. [http://freedesktop.org/pipermail/utf-8/ List archives] are available. 

IRC discussions happen in the '''#unicode''' channel on '''irc.gnome.org'''. [:Software/IrcClients: Here] is a helpful list of irc clients that support UTF-8.

=== Project UTF-8 Pages ===

	* [:Software/BadSoftware: BadSoftware]. Contrary to what Markus Kuhn is doing with his [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ], we will be trying to maintain a list of software that doesnât support UTF-8. Since UTF-8 is ''the'' character set standard, we consider every piece of software that doesnât support UTF-8 to be very old-fashioned and out of date.
	* [:Software/BMP-Only: BMP-Only]. A list of software that supports only the [:Software/BMP: BMP] of Unicode, and thus lacks full Unicode support.
	* [:Software/Fonts: Fonts]. A list of free and non-free fonts supporting various ranges of Unicode.
	* [:Software/unicode-translation: unicode-translation]. A subproject of project UTF-8 with the goal of translating Unicode character names and other data into many languages using the gettext framework.
