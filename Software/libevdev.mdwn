# libevdev

libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. it moves the common
tasks when dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a library
interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc.

The eventual goal is that libevdev wraps all ioctls available to evdev
devices, thus making direct access unnecessary.

This wiki page is largely a placeholder, documentation about libevdev and examples are available in the [API documentation](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/doc/latest).
