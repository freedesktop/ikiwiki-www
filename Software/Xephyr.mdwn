## Xephyr

Xephyr is a kdrive based X Server which targets a window on a host X Server as its framebuffer. Unlike Xnest it supports modern X extensions ( even if host server doesn't ) such as Composite, Damage, randr etc (no GLX support now). It uses SHM Images and shadow framebuffer updates to provide good performance. It also has a visual debugging mode for observing screen updates. 

Possible uses include; 

* **Xnest replacement** - Window manager, Composite 'gadget', etc development tool. 
* **Toolkit debugging** - rendundant toolkit paints can be observered easily via the debugging mode. 
* **X Server internals development** - develop without the need for an extra machine / display. 
* **[[Multiterminal with Xephyr|http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Multiterminal_with_Xephyr]]** - configuration is a single computer which supports multiple users at the same time
