The udisks project provides: 

* a daemon, udisksd, that implements well-defined D-Bus interfaces that can be used to query and manipulate storage devices. 
* a command-line tool, udisksctl, that can be used to query and use the daemon 
The actions that a user can perform using udisks are restricted using [[polkit|Software/PolicyKit]]. 


## Download

## Hacking

Join the [[mailing list|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/devkit-devel]] to get involved with feature development. 

Development happens in [[git|GettingInvolved]], in the udisks module.  There is a [[web interface|http://cgit.freedesktop.org/udisks]] to the repository.
