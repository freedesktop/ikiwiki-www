# udisks

The udisks project provides: 

* a daemon, udisksd, that implements well-defined D-Bus interfaces that can be used to query and manipulate storage devices. 
* a command-line tool, udisksctl, that can be used to query and use the daemon 
The actions that a user can perform using udisks are restricted using [[polkit|Software/PolicyKit]].
