The shared-mime-info package contains the core database of common types and the *update-mime-database* command used to extend it.  It requires glib2 to be installed for building the update command.  Additionally, it uses intltool for translations, though this is only a dependency for the maintainers.  This database is translated at [[Transifex|http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/shared-mime-info/]]. 

See [[Shared MIME Info Specification|Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec]] for more information about the database.
