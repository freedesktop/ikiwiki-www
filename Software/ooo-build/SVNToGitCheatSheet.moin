== Before you start ==

Before you do any git work, please don't forget to setup your name and email:
{{{
git config --global user.email "your@email.address.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.signingkey "0xKEY-ID"
}}}

If you want to setup these settings only for the ooo-build repository, you can omit the --global.

== git equivalents of the SVN commands ==

Please note that the git workflow is not completely 1:1 to SVN workflow thanks to the fact that the commits happen locally, and you have to additionally push the changes to the remote repository so that the changes are visible there - that's why I add ''git push'' in the table below everywhere it is necessary in order the changes appear in the remote repository.

Generally though, it is usually better not to hurry with pushing the changes, and check eg. ''git log -p'' before you do that.

== ChangeLog ==

No !ChangeLog is necessary in the git tree, it would just duplicate the information that you already have locally anyway.  Due to that, please be careful and provide nice commit messages, like:
{{{
First line roughly describing the change.

Leave one empty line, and then follow with more detailed description
what and why you changed.  It is really important to provide a good
description on the first line, because some of the git tools (like
gitk, git log --pretty=oneline, git rebase --interactive, etc.) show
just the first line.  Also we don't have a ChangeLog any more, so
git log is now your source of the information about the changes.

Please do not forget to mention the bugzilla numbers, like i#12345 or
bnc#234567.

* file1: Did this and that.
* file2: And something else here.
}}}

The commit hooks that get installed when you do ./autogen.sh should help you to create good commit messages.

== Example git session ==

{{{
# it is our first session, we have to clone the repository
git clone ssh://[username@]git.freedesktop.org/git/ooo-build/ooo-build
# develop something, now commit it
git commit -a
# continue developing, and commit it
git commit -a
# it is finished, patches apply, everything builds, let's check that we did not
# forget uncommitted changes
git status
# looks fine, let's double check the diff
git log -p
# everything is perfect, let's push to the remote repository
git push
# oh, it failed! - somebody committed some changes in the meantime, let's update
git pull -r
# double check
git log -p
# everything is fine
git push
}}}
