== Proposals ==

Feel free to add your own ideas and proposals; in case there's currently no mentor assigned to an idea, just mail the poor gsoc admin (thb at openoffice dot org) and he'll get you one.

=== Applications (Calc, Impress, Writer) ===

==== Improve Writer's compare function ====

When comparing different versions of a text document, or enabling Writer's change tracking feature, the displayed change set is rather suboptimal. Brendan had a few [[http://brendanscott.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/ooo-compare-inadequate/|ideas]] about that.

==== Hyperlink/Reference navigation buttons ====

Currently, when clicking on internal references or hyperlinks in OOo documents, there's no easy way back to the place you've started. This task is about adding browser-like navigation buttons to at least one application (preferrably Writer), that do The Right Thing when clicking them.

==== Make Impress master pages copyable ====

Currently, when in master page edit mode, the slide sorter has cut/copy/paste disabled. The task would be to add this missing functionality, and correctly handle masterpage-attached styles.

==== Attach Impress animations to styles ====

Currently, Impress styles control most of the visual shape appearance, but not the slideshow animation effect. Which is a pity, as the styles concept is pretty powerful inside OOo, and provides a nice way to change animation settings and type for a great number of objects simultaneously.

==== Impress slide layout extendibility ====

Make Impress layout templates easily extendible. Currently, the slide layouts in Impress (e.g. "Title page", "Outline page") are a hard-coded set; it would be really cool to have them extendible or even user-editable.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++
 Difficulty:: medium to hard, depends on scope

==== Implement additional 3D slideshow transitions ====

Building on top of a successful GSoC project from two years ago, the goal is to add more 3D transitions to the Impress application. A transition is an animation where one page is visible in the beginning and another in the end. It is used during presentation slideshow to switch pages.

The already existing OpenGL transition engine gets the previous and next page as a prerendered image, and then gets the stage (i.e. the screen) exclusively, for the duration of the transition.

==== Page preview for Writer ====

Modify existing Writer page preview, such that it works as a live preview side-by-side the actual edit area.

==== Style optimizer for Writer ====

Often, people format their text document in weird ways, using whitespace for formatting, putting in section numbers literally instead of using the numbering feature etc. This proposal is about detecting such suboptimal content and converting it into a properly formatted document (using styles wherever possible).

==== Natural sorting in listboxes ====

A lot of places in OOo list stuff like styles, references etc. sorted like a computer does, i.e. "1, 10, 2, ...". Which is ok though not nice for 5 items, but a PITA for a hundred. This is either some amount of work to find and fix all the places, or a task for a smart cookie to find the silver bullet that fixes this with a central 100 lines patch.

==== Word macro compatibility ====

Recently Sun and Novell announced to pool resources to provide VBA macro compatability see [http://blogs.sun.com/GullFOSS/entry/sun_and_novell_work_together here].

Currently work in the project is concentrated on providing Excel support by providing the framework for the compatibiltiy api via a plugable component, modifying the basic engine to support more compatibility features and porting the Helperapi code (for excel) to c++ (see. VBA & Porting_notes).

The task at hand would be to extend the base framework by developing helper objects and implementations to be used by both the excel and writer compatibility object implementations, and to port the existing (word) helper api objects from Java to C++

==== Improve Calc autofilter ====

In comparison to Calc, Excel 2007 has a much improved cell autofilter implementation. This proposal is about improving the existing filter inside Calc. This blog gives you the basic idea behind this task. At minimum, we are looking to add support for multiple entry selection to the existing autofilter, by adding check box to each filter item entry. If time permits, we might go even further.

==== Pimp the Start Center ====

OOo sports a start center since 3.0; taking this idea quite a bit further led to this [[http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org_Dashboard_Concept|concept]] of a dashboard. This task is about laying the foundations and at least implement a few basic items of such an OOo dashboard.

=== Filters ===

==== Create a Visio import filter for Draw ====

OOo currently lacks support for a Visio import filter. This proposal is about writing one, using the ODF format as the transport format to be loaded by the OOo application. Although a full blown filter seems to be unrealistic to be written within the short timeframe, large parts of Visio documents should be able to be filtered correctly.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++, familiarity with Visio, and a fearless attitude towards poking into binary files. 
 Difficulty:: medium

==== Implement an AutoCAD vector import for OOo ====

To complete OOo's already impressive list of import filters, this proposal is about adding an AutoCAD import for Draw. There's a spec at [3] to start from.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++, familiarity with AutoCAD, and a fearless attitude towards poking into binary files. 
 Difficulty:: medium

==== Use PDF import's layout recognition for other vector formats (e.g. postscript, wmf/emf) ====

OOo's newly implemented PDF import employs some amount of layout recognition techniques, to generate a layout-compatible document. Leveraging this framework for other vector formats will make OOo an editor not only for PDF, but also for PostScript, EMF, XPS - whatever the successful applicant for this task chooses to import.

==== Improve RTF Import (RTF Tokenizer) ====

For the ooxml Word import filter, a new filter framework is developed that has better import quality as the old separate filters, and also shares quite some code. Having the RTF import use that framework would be hugely useful; both binary doc and rtf are very similar in structure, and could have tokenizers plugged into the filter framework (and thus being handled by the same high-level filter code). The doc tokenizer is already worked on, so a RTF tokenizer would be a an awesome feature.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++
 Difficulty:: medium

==== Improve RTF Export ====

The current rework of the binary MS Word .doc (WW8) export filter made it easy to extend for other MS Word formats, like DOCX.  The aim of this task is to use the advantages of the shared code to implement a new RTF export filter based on this rework.

==== Improve Writer HTML export ====

Improve the currently lossy Writer xhtml export, to use recent features of the language.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++
 Difficulty:: medium
 Contact:: cbosdonnat at novell.com

==== Support XForms on HTML import and export ====

While both ODF and HTML have XForms support, the current Writer HTML import and export just plain ignores it. Would be awesome to have it support and round-trippable.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++, knowledge about XForms
 Difficulty:: medium
 Contact:: cbosdonnat at novell.com

==== Enhanced svg export filter ====

OOo's svg export is rather limited, it would be nice to create svgs containing multiple slides, can be navigated etc.; also, having at least minimal animation support for Impress documents would be desirable, comparable to what the Flash export filter provided for the 1.x versions.

==== (Finish) porting Impress 3D slideshow transition framework to Windows ====

With running implementations on Linux and Mac, the Windows platform is still missing for having nice 3D animated slideshow transitions in OOo. Some initial effort has been done, also in separating out operating system idiosyncrasies, but nothing is really working yet. This task is about finishing the implementation and tuning it to the Windows platform.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++, some knowledge of WGL
 Difficulty:: medium
 Contact:: rodo at novell.com

==== Crosscompile Win32 OOo on Linux ====

Setting up a build environment for OOo on Windows is a pain, requires expensive tools (at least when needing all features), and the IO performance of the used cygwin/msvs mix is rather disappointing. This task includes setting up, (if necessary) provide missing headers and tools, and actually performing a full cross build of OOo under Linux.

 Difficulty:: medium

==== Support document versioning via WebDAV ====

OOo has good support for WebDAV and is thusly well suited to work on documents directly stored on a (web)server. Additionally cool would be to have support for document versioning as well, as provided by the DeltaV WebDAV protocol extension. This task is about adding support for DeltaV to the already existing WebDAV implementation, at least basic "core-versioning".

==== Implement XCanvas using CoreGraphics ====

With a DirectX-based Canvas implementation already available for Windows, and a cairo-based one for Linux, it's a natural move to provide a CoreGraphics-based on for the native Mac OS X platform OOo has recently been ported to. This proposal is about providing an initial XCanvas-implementation that solely uses CoreGraphics for rendering.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++, objective c, Mac OS X knowledge
 Difficulty:: medium

==== Port OOo to Haiku ====

Add missing pieces to the ongoing OOo port for the Haiku operating system. Missing pieces e.g. are a working java port, and UNO bridges.

 Required skills/knowledge:: c++, Haiku knowledge
 Difficulty:: can be hard, depending on area

==== KDE4 integration for OOo ====

OOo can use the KDE3 and Gtk+ themes, but not KDE4.  There exist a preliminary port of the KDE3 theming plugin to KDE4, but it is incomplete, and crashes.  Also the implementation of the KDE4 file dialog for OOo is missing.  This task covers improving at least the 2 mentioned, but improvements in other KDE4-integration areas, like KDE address book, icons, etc. is welcome as well.

 Required skills/knowledge:: C++, KDE 4.x, Qt 4.x
 Difficulty:: medium to hard
 Contact:: kendy at suse cz

==== Samba locking for GIO ====

OOo has a UCB (universal content provider) that can reach data over GIO (gvfs).  Unfortunately, the implementation of the samba protocol there lacks the locking functionality.  This task covers the implementation of samba locking for GIO on all levels where appropriate - changes in OOo, in glib and gvfs, and even in fuse if necessary.

 Required skills/knowledge:: C, C++, glib
 Difficulty:: hard

==== Patch Open Office to use native GTK for menus and implement a Global Menu client inside it. ====

It has been long known that Open Office doesn't use native GTK, and therefore can not benefit from the Global Menu's GTK Plugin. However no fully usable office suite that utilizes native GTK is available. The result is direct: on a desktop with Global Menu enabled, the default office suite, which is accessed by the user almost everyday becomes an exception that behaves differently from all other applications. Too bad. This proposed SOC project aims to provide a patch for the Open Office & Global Menu users. With the work planned in KDE to implement a GlobalMenu and XFCE already working, this will provide one of the last parts in an integration on the main Linux desktop environnments.

References:

    * Global Menu Specification - http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/wiki/GlobalMenuSpecification 

Goals

Patch Openoffice to implement a Global Menu client inside it.

    * Interpolate the menu into Global Menu XML
    * Bind the XML to the toplevel window
    * Receive and understands the Global Menu events 

 Required skills/knowledge::
    * Experience with Openoffice programming model
    * C++ experience
    * Knowledge in X11 or GDK 
 Difficulty:: 
 Contact:: kendy at suse dot cz, the GlobalMenu developpers will provide mentoring for the GTK and GlobalMenu part

==== Standalone presentation viewer ====

In comparison to PowerPoint, OOo Impress does not have a standalone presentation viewer, although this greatly simplifies handling for inexperienced users. Furthermore, it offers a chance to pursue different routes in terms of UI and functionality, that might not (easily) fit in the main Impress application.

==== GUI builder for OOo ====

There's currently work under way to give OOo auto-layoutable dialogs based on an xml description language, which is based on a GSoC 2007 project. The task at hand targets the generation of those xml UI description files in a UI-designer-friendly way - in short, to provide a GUI builder for OOo. Conceivable ways of reaching that goal also include programming a Glade plugin

==== Template preview ====

Currently, OOo's template dialogs provide hard-coded previews, that do not take the document at hand into consideration. This proposal is about providing true preview functionality in the template dialog, such that a user can judge appearance of individual templates before actually applying it.

==== Performance Improvement ====

There are several known performance bottlenecks inside OpenOffice, and clearly more can be found with improved profiling. The exciting part of this task is clearly, finding and understanding sillies in the code - mis-uses of otherwise sensible APIs, problematic code structures and so on; and then with the minimum of code tweaking make them fly. As part of this, a small improvement to KCachegrind's visualisation will also be required (basic C++). We will also look at reducing memory use as an extensions. Not really a single task, but a collection of incremental wins over some weeks.

==== uno-skeletonmaker: generate code based on templates ====

Modify or rewrite the uno-skeletonmaker to make it templatable. The current implementation is completely hard-coded. Every developer has its own development style guide and has to change the generated code every time, which is a PITA.

==== Use svg for OOo icons ====

OOo uses png for its icons sets currently; with the trend towards higher display resolution and scalable UI, using an expressive vector format would be useful. This task is about adding proper svg rendering capabilities to the lower layers of OOo, and using that for standard OOo icon sets.

==== Enable external Basic IDE ====

OOo proposes an old IDE for the edition of Basic macros. To provide the comfort a modern IDEs to the users, a connection has to be established with OOo basic engine. This task is about implementing a way to communicate with the basic engine using UNO interfaces. A basic integration in Eclipse will have to be done in order to have a working sample IDE.

 Required skills/knowledge:: C++, Java, Eclipse knowledge...

==== Photo album extension ====

Add an extension to the Impress which will enable users to easily create photo album presentations from supplied photos. It should layout the photos on pages - possibly using smart shapes, set transitions and animation effects. Various options should be available in the UI to customize the presentation parameters before it is created.

==== Extension: Integrate Ocropus OCR capabilities to OpenOffice.org ====

Add an extension to Writer or Draw which will enable users to easily open/scan images and perform optical character recognition(OCR) in order to output editable text with layout. The most promising free OCR programme is Ocropus (www.ocropus.org), which lacks a GUI, though. This Openoffice extension should provide a bridge between Ocropus and OpenOffice.org. The extension should be able to start an OCR scan of an image using Ocropus and directly sending the resulting hocr output file (based on HTML) to OpenOffice.org, where it is imported in Writer or Draw as editable text with layout. 

An integration of this extension into the PDF-import of OpenOffice.org could be evaluated at a later stage.
