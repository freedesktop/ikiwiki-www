The complete account request information is available on [[AccountRequests|AccountRequests]] page, here is a short version. 

Create a bug on [[http://bugs.freedesktop.org|http://bugs.freedesktop.org]] for product "freedesktop.org", component "New Accounts", named "Request for account for ooo-build" containing the following information: 

* real name 
* email address 
* preferred account name 
* GPG public key 
* RSA SSH public key 
Add kendy at suse cz to the CC:, so that I can approve your request. 


## GPG key

If you don't have one yet, do: 
[[!format txt """
gpg --gen-key # choose default values everywhere it asks you anything
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --send-keys 0xTHEIDENTIFICATION # to send it to the server
gpg --export -a <your email address> # that's what you should send me
"""]]
**And keep your private key secure!** 

We also need you to be reasonably connected to the GPG network, so please find someone who can sign your key - you'll probably have to do this in person. 


## RSA SSH key

You probably want to have a special key for the freedesktop.org account.  To create it: 
[[!format txt """
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/yourname-fdo
# send ~/.ssh/yourname-fdo.pub to me
# edit your ~/.ssh/config to contain:
Host *.freedesktop.org
    User yourusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/yourname-fdo
"""]]
**And keep your private key secure!**
