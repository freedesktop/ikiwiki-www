* [[D-Bus 1.2.6|http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.2.6.tar.gz]]. (2008-12-05) 
Joachim Breitner discovered a mistake in the default configuration for the system bus (system.conf) which made the default policy for both sent and received messages was effectively *allow*, and not deny as stated.  

This release fixes the send side permission, but does not change the receive.  See [[the release announcement|http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2008-December/010702.html]] for more information. 

Contributors to this release: Tomas Hoger, Joachim Breitner, Colin Walters. Bugs fixed in this release: 

[[http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18229|http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18229]]: Fix for CVE-2008-4311 

* [[D-Bus 1.2.4 "Not yet in the kernel"|http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.2.4.tar.gz]]. (2008-10-06) 
Bugs fixed in this release: 

[[http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17803|http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17803]]: Fix for CVE-2008-3834 

A small number of compilation and portability fixes are included as well, for details see the git log. 

* [[D-Bus 1.0.2|http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.0.2.tar.gz]]. stable release. (2006-12-12) 
Bugs fixed in this release: Fix security bug CVE-2006-6107 match rules can be removed by apps that did not create them pthread fix 

* [[D-Bus 1.1.4|http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.1.4.tar.gz]]. development/unstable release. (2008-01-17) 
   * This release is intended to be Release Candidate 2 of major release D-Bus 1.2.0.  If nothing is found to be wrong with this release it will become 1.2.0 within a week.  If we need to make major changes we will release an RC3 and start the process over. 
   * Fixes inotify support  
* [[D-Bus 1.1.2|http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.1.2.tar.gz]] development/unstable release. (2007-07-27) 
   * This release is intended to be a feature complete beta for stable release 1.2.0, please test it. 1.2.0 will follow pretty soon if no major problems are found. We'll do more betas if significant changes are made. 
   * This is a development release, so API's may still change if problems are found (though we will try hard not to). 
   * The system bus now supports starting services on demand. This uses a setuid helper program because system bus daemon runs as a nobody user, while services it launches may need to run as a different user. _**Extra eyes auditing the setuid helper are encouraged and would be timely right now, before 1.2.0. **_A design doc is available in doc/system-activation.txt 
   * The TCP address format has been enhanced, such that TCP may be actually usable. The dbus-daemon man page describes the new elements in the address format. 1.1.1 had added an all_interfaces flag to the format, which has been removed in favor of a cleaner approach. 
   * Some thread-related bugs have been fixed, these are important fixes if you are using multiple threads with libdbus, and not important otherwise.
