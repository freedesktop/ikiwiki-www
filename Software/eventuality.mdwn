The project goal for Eventuality is to create a DBUS based framework for creating a flexible means of scheduling arbitrary "actions" to be performed by conforming apps. See our [[FAQ|Software/Eventuality/FAQ.txt]]. Also, before some real action happens, you may be interested in [[discussion|http://freedesktop.org/pipermail/xdg/2004-July/004239.html]] that happened on XDG list.
