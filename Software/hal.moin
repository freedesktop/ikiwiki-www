= HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer =

||<#FF8080> HAL [[http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/hal/2008-May/011560.html|is in maintenance mode]] - no new features are added. All future development focuses on [[Software/udisks|udisks]], [[http://upower.freedesktop.org/|upower]] and other parts of the stack.  See [[Software/DeviceKit]] for more information. ||

These pages attempt to provide a specification and an implementation of a hardware abstraction layer.<<BR>>
For a good background on what a HAL does, see the [[http://www.ometer.com/hardware.html|"Making Hardware Just Work"]]  article that motivated this work.

 * Tarballs are available at [[http://hal.freedesktop.org/releases/|http://hal.freedesktop.org/releases/]]

=== GIT ===

Git is now being used for HAL.  There is a [[http://freedesktop.org/wiki/UsingGit|nice tutorial for using git with freedesktop.org projects]]. There is also another tutorial at [[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-git/|IBM Developerworks site]]. You can also take a look at [[http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=hal.git;a=blob;f=HACKING]].

=== hal-info ===

hal-info is a small hal sub-package that provides the hardware data and quirks. These quirks are currently things like what mice support reporting battery status, what music players are supported and what cameras are detected.

hal-info and hal should not be packaged together. When packaging hal, it should depend on hal-info, of any version.
hal-info should also be checked out in the same level directory as hal if you intend to use ./run-hald.sh

There are no official tarball releases yet, but you can get the latest code from [[http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=hal-info.git;a=tree|git]] and release tar.gz from [[http://hal.freedesktop.org/releases/|http://hal.freedesktop.org/releases/]]. See [[http://hughsient.livejournal.com/6702.html|here]] for more information.
