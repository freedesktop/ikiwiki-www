= HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer =

These pages attempt to provide a specification and an implementation of a hardware abstraction layer. For a good backgound on what a HAL does, see the [http://www.ometer.com/hardware.html "Making Hardware Just Work"]  article that has motivated this work.

	* [wiki:Software/HalBuildInstructions Building from CVS] - try out the [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/hal/hal/ChangeLog?view=markup latest stuff]!

	* CVS HEAD hosts source code for HAL 0.5.x releases that require Linux kernel 2.6.10, udev 050 and using /sbin/udevsend as the hotplug multiplexer/helper (latest is HAL 0.5.0) - [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/*checkout*/hal/hal/doc/spec/hal-spec.html?only_with_tag=HEAD spec]

	* The HAL 0.4.x branch works with 2.6.8 Linux kernels and udev/hotplug (latest is HAL 0.4.7) - [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/*checkout*/hal/hal/doc/spec/hal-spec.html?only_with_tag=hal-0_4-stable-branch spec]


	* Tarballs are [http://freedesktop.org/~david/dist/ here]
