## Getting the sources

libvisio sources are stored in [[git|http://git-scm.com/]].  To get them, you can use: 

    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/libreoffice/libvisio/

or you can browse the code [[online|http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/libvisio/]]. 

If you want to use release version you can fetch it from [[libreoffice mirror|http://dev-www.libreoffice.org/src/]]. 


## Building it


### Dependencies

You will need these applications and libraries in order to compile libvisio: 

    boost
    gperf
    icu
    libxml2
    >=libwpd-0.9
    >=libwpg-0.2
    perl
    zlib
    doxygen # optional for documentation building (--with-docs)

Once the source has been checked out, libvisio can be built in usual manner: 

    cd libvisio
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install

## Contributing

Once you have done a change that you are happy with, and that builds
with libvisio, contribute it back, we'll be happy to integrate it!
There are two ways to get your contribution to us:

1. submitting it to gerrit (preferred, easier if you already have
   done the initial setup)
1. sending a patch

Both methods require that you commit the changes to your local
repository first:
[[!format txt """
git commit -a
"""]]
The submission differs by method and is discussed in the following
sections.

### Gerrit
This section draws heavily on documentation for libreoffice.

You need to have an account in [[libreoffice
gerrit|https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/]]. How to do that is discussed in
length
[[here|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/setup]]
(the logerrit tool is in libreoffice repo, but the manual way works).
After you have done that, you are ready to push your change(s). How to
do that manually is described
    [[here|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/SubmitPatch]].
    Alternatively, there is a tool called
    [[git-review|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GitReview]]
    that makes it (IMHO) much easier.

As an example, if you are using
[[git-review|https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GitReview]],
you submit you change(s) with plain
[[!format txt """
git review
"""]]

### Sending patches
[[!format txt """
git format-patch origin/master
"""]]
will create one or more patch files. You can send these to
[[libreoffice@lists.freedesktop.org|mailto:libreoffice@lists.freedesktop.org]] .
