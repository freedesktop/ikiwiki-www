=== systemd System and Service Manager ===

What is this?

 `systemd` is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts. `systemd` provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Spelling:

 Yes, it is written '''systemd''', not '''system D''' or '''System D''', or even '''SystemD'''. And it isn't '''system d''' either. Why? Because it's a system daemon, and under Unix/Linux those are in lower case, and get suffixed with a lower case '''d'''. And since systemd manages the system, it's called systemd. It's that simple. The only situation were we find it OK to use an uppercase letter in the name (but don't like it either) is if you start a sentence with '''systemd'''. On high holidays you may also spell it ''sÿstëmd''. But then again, ''Système D'' is not an acceptable spelling and something completely different (though kinda fitting).
