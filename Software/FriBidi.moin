== GNU FriBidi ==

GNU FriBidi is an implementation of the [http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/ Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (bidi)] and Arabic Joining/Shaping.

The GNU FriBidi API isn't finished yet, and the design is by no means set in stone.  Right now the next goal is to add [:Software/FriBidiOnline: online bidi] capability to GNU FriBidi.  One of our main goals as a GNU project is for lots of projects to use it, so if you wouldn't use it, by all means mail us and say why - design, licensing, indentation style, we would rather know than not know. 

GNU FriBidi has no required dependencies, but the versions after 0.10.4 take advantage of Glib if available.  The [:Software/FriBidiProjects: list of projects using GNU FriBidi] is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from.

Trying out GNU FriBidi in sample applications is encouraged - we want to get it widely used and tested. It should be working pretty well these days, and when it isn't bug reports are very welcome. 

GNU FriBidi was formerly hosted on [http://sourceforge.net/projects/fribidi sourceforge.net].  It was moved here after being dubbed a [http://www.gnu.org/ GNU] project by [http://stallman.org/ Richard Stallman] two times!


=== Mailinglist ===

All GNU FriBidi discussion is currently on [http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/fribidi/ fribidi at lists freedesktop org] (formerly [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=3189 fribidi-discuss at sourceforge net]).


=== CVS ===

The main [:GettingInvolved: CVS] module is "fribidi". You can browse it with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/fribidi/fribidi/ ViewCVS].

CVS commits can be monitored on the [http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/fribidi-commit/ fribidi-commit] mailing list.

The [:GettingInvolved: CVS] repository of pre-2004 activities is available in module "fribidi-sf.net".  You can browse it with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/fribidi/fribidi-sf.net/ ViewCVS].  If you use this old module, make sure you check out the STABLE 
branch, not HEAD.
