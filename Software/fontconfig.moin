== Fontconfig ==

Fontconfig is a library for configuring and customizing font access.

=== About Fontconfig ===

Fontconfig can:
	* discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common source of configuration problems.
	* perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative fonts can be selected if fonts are missing.
	* identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of languages.
	* have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based configuration file (though with autodiscovery, we believe this need is minimized).
	* efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among the set of fonts you have installed, even if you have installed thousands of fonts, while minimzing memory usage.
	* be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType to implement high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a display.
		 
Fontconfig does not:
	* render the fonts themselves (this is left to FreeType or other rendering mechanisms)
	* depend on the X Window System in any fashion, so that printer only applications do not have such dependencies
