### Draft Recommendations for Default Unicode Fonts By Script

**Introduction**  

Free/Libre Open Source (FLOSS) desktop infrastructure has matured rapidly in the last few years.  As part of this phenomenon, an increasing number of modern Unicode fonts for numerous human scripts have become available under FLOSS licenses such as the GPL, Vera Bitstream-style licenses, and, most recently, the Open Font License (OFL) [[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL|http://scripts.sil.org/OFL]]. An additional number of fonts are available for "free download" under licensing terms that are not yet       as clear as many in the Free/Open Source and Free Desktop community would like. A number of these Free/Libre and otherwise open Unicode fonts are referenced in Ed Trager's _Unicode Font Guide For Free/Libre Open Source Operating Systems_ on **unifont.org**.  Fonts specifically released under the OFL are referenced on SIL's _OFL Fonts_ page on **sil.org**.  URLs to both sites are provided above.  Links to additional font resources may be found toward the bottom of this document. 

As GNU/Linux and other Free Software / Open Source operating systems become mainstream all over the world, there is an increasing need for distributors of these operating systems to be able to build out font infrastructure from a common basis or set of standards. 

This draft document represents the beginnings of one part of that effort and follows from a recent discussion at the GNOME User and Developer European Conference (GUADEC, [[http://guadec.org/|http://guadec.org/]]) on figuring out the most appropriate FLOSS fonts that a distribution could choose for various Unicode script blocks. Earlier discussions at the Libre Graphics Meeting, the Ubuntu Summit and the LSB meetings also touched upon improving the situation with fonts on the free desktop at large. 

The task of choosing a set of default fonts has both _objective_ and _subjective_ aspects to it. 

On the objective side, it is obviously necessary to evaluate how well a given font covers a given script and the orthographies of human languages which use that script.  It is also necessary to decide whether a font is easy to read on screen and on paper.  In the case of Indic, Indic-derived and Middle Eastern scripts, it is often also necessary to evaluate the sets of ligatures and glyph substitutions that need to occur for proper orthographies. 

On the subjective side, it is necessary to decide whether a font sufficiently agrees with a language community or nation's _collective consciousness_ about how typeset letters and words should look.  For example, by now most people who have been following the various debates on Unicode over the last few years are well aware that the Japanese have a slightly different standard from the Chinese on how many Kanji/Hanzi/漢字 should appear.  A much less well-known example is that the Vietnamese, who use a Latin orthography in their modern writing, expect to see slightly greater vertical line spacing by default to accomodate the numerous diacritical marks that are required by their orthography. 

Given the complex interaction between the objective and subjective tests that a font must "pass" in order to be accepted as a good default, it should be evident that it will very likely be _impossible_ to please everyone in every language community.  Limitations in current software, especially in how the Font****Config library can be configured, make it even more certain that pleasing everyone is an unrealistic goal. 

Nevertheless, we trust that the combined and constructive efforts of the Free/Open Source community will lead to the genesis of a set of very reasonable defaults that will meet the needs of the majority of users in most language communities especially when fonts can be modified or branched thanks to an appropriate license. 


#### Testing

For testing fonts, especially Open****Type ones, please read [[http://pravin-s.blogspot.com/2008/02/how-to-test-open-type-fonts.html|http://pravin-s.blogspot.com/2008/02/how-to-test-open-type-fonts.html]] 

Please collect test material on per-script pages and link them from the [[Software/Fonts/Tests|Software/Fonts/Tests]] page. 

**Notes About Terminology Used in Font Classification** 

The [[FontConfig|FontConfig]] library uses the terms _serif_, _sans_, and _monospace_ to describe three distinct categories of fonts.  In modern Western typography, these terms have reasonable meanings.  However, when applied in a more global script context, these terms are less adequate.  In a global context, it would be much better to use the terms _modulated_ and _unmodulated_ instead of _serif_ and _sans_, respectively.  A _modulated_ font is one in which the thickness of the stroke varies visibly whereas an _unmodulated_ font is one in which the thickness does not appear to vary appreciably when perceived by the human eye. 

In this global script context, _serif_ represents a _subset of mostly Western fonts in the larger global set of all modulated fonts_, while _sans_ likewise represents a different _subset of mostly Western fonts in the larger global set of unmodulated fonts_.  

Note also that _monospace_ fonts can only be created for a limited subset of scripts in the world. 

Finally, a number of vector and bitmap fonts have been carefully designed to maximize readability on computer screens.  Font****Config does not currently distinguish a category of _screen_ fonts.  However, it is worthwhile for us to do so nevertheless. 

Please put down the names of each font family along with the current license.

**East Asian Scripts** 

* Chinese: 
      * Unmodulated: Same as modulated one (see note below) 
      * Modulated: AR PL Shan Hei Sun Uni (APL). ( 宋 Song/Sung/Sun ) style. 
      * Screen: Currently probably must remain the same as the modulated one: In the near future, we expect Wen Quan Yi Bitmap Font 文泉驿 (GPL) 
            * will be preferred once the fontconfig bitmap-in-TTF issues on Linux are resolved. 
_Nota bene_: 

            * Recent Chinese Unicode font projects make the division into simplified (简体字) vs. traditional (繁體字/正體字) fonts obsolete. 
            * The chinese font style matching 'unmodulated' is Hei style (黑体). All publicly available Hei style fonts are commercial ones. "AR PL Zen****Kai Uni" is in "楷体" style (Kai style), which is used generally for artistic purposes, but rarely on screen. Nor is it an unmodulated one. 
                  * As people in the Taiwan Area, HK/Macao, SE Asia, N America and the mainland appear to disagree on the preferable looks of traditional (Hant) glyphs, and as these design differences within the Sinosphere seem to be of more or less the same severity as differences between _hanzi_ and _hanja_ fonts (the latter of which apparently follow the Kangxi Dictionary, whose designs were also still palatable enough in parts of the Sinosphere to make it into Windows' MingLiU _hanzi_ font where they have only recently been [[replaced|http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/新細明體更新套件]] with other shapes/variants), perhaps somebody should find out how pronounced, systematic or even explicit those intra-Hant preferences are and whether they would justify splitting this section into different regions. (For examples of intra-Hant differences either in minor shape details or in preferred glyph variants, see [[1|http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vergleich_zh-Hant-CN_zh-Hant-TW_ja-Hani_ko-Hani.png]]·[[2|http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Differences_of_Chinese_characters_between_places.png]]·[[3|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Chinese_character#Example_Characters]]·[[4|http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=6EAB]]) 
                  * There are a number of screenshots on the WWW showing Kai style in UIs, so it seems it is not quite that rare. 
            * Wen Quan Yi is a truetype font containing bitmap glyphs **only**, so it doesn't work very well with vanilla fontconfig. Patch for fontconfig is needed. Besides, it can't be used for high-quality printing. 
* Japanese: 
      * Unmodulated: Sazanami Gothic (project-specific BSD-like DFSG compatible) 
      * Modulated: Sazanami Mincho (project-specific BSD-like DFSG compatible) 
      * Screen: Sazanami Gothic (project-specific BSD-like DFSG compatible) 
* Korean: 
      * Unmodulated: Un Dotum (GPL) 
      * Modulated: Un Batang (GPL) 
      * Screen: Either of the above 
      * Monospace: 
            * 1st choice: Un Dotum 
            * 2nd choice: Eun Guseul Mono (GPL), combining with [[DejaVu|DejaVu]] Sans Mono (Vera-style FLOSS license) 
      * For Middle Korean, the only free Unicode font is Un Jamo****Batang (GPL). 
* Mongolian: 
      * “FLOSS systems do not yet support Mongolian. There are a number of problems…” ([[EH Trager 2006|http://www.unifont.org/textlayout/TheBigPicture.pdf]]; the same goes for Xibe, Manchu, and pre-1930 Tuvan)

### Generic fonts.conf configuration file

A Linux distribution can fine tune the precise font that will be used to render a specific language/script using the configuration files found in /etc/fonts/ 

We made a list of such existing configuration files, at [[Software/Fonts/fonts.conf|Software/Fonts/fonts.conf]]. If your distribution is not listed, please add the corresponding configuration file.
