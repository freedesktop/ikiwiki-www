papyon is an MSN library purely written in Python. It is the library behind the Telepathy MSN connection manager, telepathy-butterfly. papyon is a fork of the unmaintained [[pymsn|http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Pymsn]] MSN library. The GLib mainloop is used to process the network events in an asynchronous manner.

## Troubleshooting


### OverflowError: long too big to convert

If you get something like that: 

   * _Overflow Error: long too big to convert (while registering property 'bytes-transferred' for GType 'papyon+msnp2p+P2PMessage')_ 
you probably would need to update your python gobject binding. This is a known bug of python gobject that was fixed in python gobject 2.10.1.
