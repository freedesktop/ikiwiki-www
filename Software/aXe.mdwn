## Apportion X Extension (aXe)

This extension causes a entire sub-tree of the window hierarchy to be rendered to an off-screen buffer.  Applications can then take the contents of that buffer and do whatever they like.  The off-screen buffer can be automatically merged into the parent window or merged manually.  Manual merging should enable lots of fun effects.
