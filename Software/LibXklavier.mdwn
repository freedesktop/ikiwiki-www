## General info

The current features are: 

   * Reading XKB configuration registry information (for XFree86) 
   * Configuring XKB 
   * Application-defined callbacks for many XKB-related events 
   * Support for per-window switching etc. 
Requirements: 

   * Proper support of XKB on X server and X client side 
   * Any version of X.Org or XFree86 4.3 or above with support of multiple layouts and base.xml/xorg.xml/xfree.xml configuration registry present 

## Documentation

The API documentation can be found [[here|http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/doc]]. 

Short document regarding "Why multiple layouts rock" is recommended for reading - available [[in PDF format|http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkbconfig.pdf]] and [[in OOo format|http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkbconfig.sxw]]. 

Some problems of XKB (and XFree implementation) are listed here: [[in PDF format|http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/antixkb.pdf]] and [[in OOo format|http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/antixkb.sxw]].

## X servers support

The library is designed to be usable with any X server with proper implementation of XKB extenstion. So far, it was only tested on XFree86 XKB implementation. The author is interested in supporting other X servers as well. He would be very grateful for any information/patches/feedback regarding usage of libxklavier on platforms other than XOrg/XFree86.
