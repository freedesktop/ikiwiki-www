= What is D-Bus? =
D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, or through unencrypted TCP/IP suitable for use behind a firewall with shared NFS home directories. (Help wanted with [:Software/DBusRemote:better remote transports] - the transport mechanism is well-abstracted and extensible.)

The D-Bus [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus/api/html/index.html low-level API reference implementation] and [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html protocol] have been heavily tested in the real world over several years, and are now "set in stone." Future changes will either be compatible or versioned appropriately.

The low-level libdbus reference implementation has no required dependencies; the bus daemon's only *required* dependency is an XML parser (either libxml or expat). Higher-level bindings specific to particular frameworks (Qt, GLib, Java, C#, Python, etc.) add more dependencies, but can make more assumptions and are thus much simpler to use. The bindings evolve separately from the low-level libdbus, so some are more mature and ABI-stable than others; check the docs for the binding you plan to use.

There are also some reimplementations of the D-Bus protocol for languages such as C#, Java, and Ruby. These do not use the libdbus reference implementation.

The [:Software/DbusProjects:list of projects using D-Bus] is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from.

D-Bus is very portable to any Linux or UNIX flavor, and a port to Windows is in progress.

If you have any trouble with D-Bus or suggestions for improvement, bug reports and comments are very welcome.

= Mailing List =
All D-Bus discussion is currently on [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/ dbus@lists.freedesktop.org].

= Reporting Bugs & Sending Patches =
Please report bugs (and submit patches) through the freedesktop.org [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ Bugzilla].

Ideally, include test suite coverage with your patch; or if you report a bug, it's good to add a test that fails even if you don't have a patch otherwise. You can see test coverage stats in the GNOME build bot results, at http://build.gnome.org:8080/coverage/dbus/lcov/ (note, coverage is understated since it counts the test code itself in the coverage, and the test suite does not test itself, in particular all the "test failed" codepaths are not covered).

Patches to improve test coverage are very welcome, though D-Bus is already among the best-covered codebases around.

= Documentation =
Some stuff from the doc/ subdirectory is prebuilt and browsable here. If you're new to D-Bus, the tutorial is probably the best place to start (even though it is very incomplete, the basics are covered).

Generic D-Bus protocol information:

 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html D-Bus specification]
 * [:IntroductionToDBus:An introduction to the basics] by Jeroen Vermeulen
 * [http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/intro-to-dbus.html Introduction to D-Bus] from the Qt documentation
 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-faq.html FAQ]
 * Overview picture [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/diagram.png png] [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/diagram.svg svg]
 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html D-Bus tutorial (incomplete, has stuff on several bindings and reimplementations)]
 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/busconfig.dtd Config file DTD]
Please note that the D-Bus spec is incomplete, especially in its description of the message bus daemon. The spec for the protocol itself is reasonably complete, though not always clear or precise. Your patches are welcome! In the meantime, you may need to supplement your reading of the spec with a reading of the reference implementation source code.

Docs specific to the reference implementation:

 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus/api/html/index.html API reference manual for the reference implementation (libdbus)]
 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus/api/html/todo.html @todo items from reference implementation manual] and high-level [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/TODO TODO]

 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/NEWS NEWS] [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/ChangeLog ChangeLog] [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/README README]
 * [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-test-plan.html Test plan]
 * [http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/dbus-docs.tar.gz Tarball] with most of the above docs.
Keep in mind that libdbus is a low-level library, intended to be the backend for a language binding and with extra complexity needed to implement dbus-daemon. You will save yourself a lot of pain if you use a higher-level wrapper or a reimplementation.

== Reference Implementation (dbus-daemon and libdbus) ==
libdbus version numbers are X.Y.Z where an even number for Y indicates a stable release, each major release series has the same X.Y, and each bugfix release increments Z. ABI will not be broken once it appears in a stable release (with an even-numbered Y).

The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.0.2.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0.2]. (2006-12-12)

 * Fix security bug CVE-2006-6107 match rules can be removed by apps that did not create them
 * pthread fix
The previous release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.0.1.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0.1]. (2006-11-17)

 * Fix bug where calling dbus_threads_init_default would assert
 * Fix UUID output to match the spec
 * Clear up documentation on UUIDs
Previous releases can be found in the [:Software/DbusReleaseArchive:release archive].

== Reference Implementation, Development Version (dbus-daemon and libdbus) ==
libdbus version numbers are X.Y.Z where an odd number for Y indicates an unstable release which may be buggy and may contain not-yet-final ABI. Use these at your own risk, and you should probably avoid shipping them in a stable operating system release. However, testing is appreciated.

The latest development release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.1.3.tar.gz D-Bus 1.1.3]. (2008-01-15)

 * This release is intended to be Release Candidate 1 of major release D-Bus 1.2.0.  If nothing is found to be wrong with this release it will become 1.2.0 within a week.  If we need to make major changes we will release an RC2 and start the process over again.
 * This is a development release, so API's may still change if problems are found (though this is extreamly unlikely).
 * DTD for the introspection format is fixed and uploaded to the servers
 * Sources now reside in a git repository at http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus.git;a=summary
 * Argument path matching of the type arg0path='/aa/bb/' is now supported (see the specification for more information)
 * New error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ObjectPathInUse added
 * Autolaunched busses now save their parameters in X11 if possible making them behave closer to busses launched through the normal mechanisms
 * inotify is now the default backend for watching configuration file changes
 * More support for the AIX platform has been added
 * Numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements

== Bindings and Independent Implementations ==
Bindings and independent implementations are linked to from the [:Software/DBusBindings:Bindings Page].

A binding wraps libdbus (and thus automatically gets e.g. new authentication mechanisms and other additions to libdbus), while a reimplementation codes the protocol from scratch (and thus avoids a dependency on the libdbus C library, but has to be kept in sync with new features). We are working on a hybrid approach where libdbus can be used to set up connections but bindings don't use the message queue or message marshaling from libdbus.

= Windows port =
Until the merge with the official D-Bus code, the Windows port is hosted on Sourceforge: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/windbus winDBus]. Until the Windows port is merged into the reference implementation and documented in the spec, keep in mind that what eventually gets merged into the reference implementation and spec may not match the current winDBus code's behavior or API.

= Grab the Source =

The core dbus code and the language bindings are under version control using Git.  There is a [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Infrastructure/git nice tutorial for using git with freedesktop.org projects]. There is also [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-git/ another tutorial at IBM Developerworks site].

All components of dbus are in the dbus/ subdirectory.
