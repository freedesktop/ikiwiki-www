= What is D-Bus? =

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, but TCP/IP option is available and [wiki:Software/DBusRemote remote support] planned.

The D-Bus API isn't finished yet, and the design is by no means set in stone. One of our main goals is for lots of projects to use it, so if you wouldn't use it, by all means mail us and say why - design, licensing, indentation style, we would rather know than not know.

D-Bus' only *required* dependency is an XML parser (either libxml or expat). D-Bus includes many language bindings to the D-Bus system, if you want to build those. The [wiki:Software/DbusProjects list of projects using D-Bus] is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from.

Trying out D-Bus in sample applications is encouraged - we want to get it widely used and tested. It should be working pretty well these days, and when it isn't bug reports are very welcome.

Get on D-Bus today!


= Mailinglist =

All D-Bus discussion is currently on [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/ dbus@lists.freedesktop.org] (formerly message-bus-list''''''@freedesktop.org).


= Grab the Source =

== CVS ==

The [wiki:GettingInvolved CVS] module for this spec is "dbus". You can browse it with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/ ViewCVS].

CVS commits can be monitored on the [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus-commit/ dbus-commit] mailing list.

== GIT ==

Git is now being used for some of the language bindings in D-Bus.  There is a [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/UsingGit nice tutorial for using git with freedesktop.org projects].  There is also [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-git/ another tutorial at IBM Developerworks site].

= Reporting Bugs & Sending Patches =

Please report bugs (and submit patches) through the freedesktop.org [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ Bugzilla].

= Language Bindings =

Bindings have been split from the core.  Please visit the [wiki:Software/DBusBindings Bindings Page] to find out where you can get the latest bindings from.

= Documentation =

Some stuff from the doc/ subdirectory is prebuilt and browsable here. If you're new to D-Bus, the tutorial is
probably the best place to start (even though it is very incomplete, the basics are covered).

== Core ==

The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-0.92.tar.gz dbus-0.92.tar.gz]. (2006-08-18)

	* Proper thread locking added to pending calls
	* Threading semantics changed from init early to init before the second thread is started
	* Correctly error out when an application tries to acquire or release the org.freedesktop.DBus name instead of sending false result codes
	* kqueue directory watching code can now be used to monitor config file changes on FreeBSD
	* --with-dbus-daemondir configure switch added so the daemon can be installed separate from the user binaries
	* Makefiles fixed for cygwin
	* Various fixes for the ongoing Windows port
	* Fixed docs and comments to use the D-Bus spelling instead of D-BUS

	* Binary modules are now installed in the correct directory
	* Distutils exports the dbus and dbus-glib cflags

The previous release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-python/dbus-python-0.70.tar.gz dbus-python-0.70.tar.gz]. (2006-07-17)

== GLib Bindings ==

The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib/dbus-glib-0.71.tar.gz dbus-glib-0.71.tar.gz]. (2006-07-24)
	* Correctly installs a few missing headers
	* Build was cleaned up a bit

The previous release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib/dbus-glib-0.70.tar.gz dbus-glib-0.70.tar.gz]. (2006-07-17)
	* First release after bindings split
	* dbus-binding-tool heeds org.freedesktop.DBus.GLib.ClientCSymbol C symbol name annotations when generating glib client bindings
	* DBusGProxy can now be inherited from
	* Support added for generating bindings to arrays that are represented as G!PtrArrays rather than GArrays (ie size-variable things, such as strings, objects, structs, etc).
	* Modification of the existing specialised types to have N type parameters (rather than the current 1 or 2 for arrays and dictionaries respectively). You can then use this to get a glib type to represent any arbitrary D-Bus struct type using dbus_g_type_get_struct. The only implementation of these types is with G!ValueArrays as before, but it's now possible to store these in arrays, emit them in signals, etc.
	* New method dbus_g_connection_open provides a way to open connections to an arbitrary address
	* Various bugs and memory leaks fixed
