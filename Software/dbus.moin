= What is D-Bus? =

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication,
D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, or through unencrypted TCP/IP suitable for use behind a firewall with shared NFS home directories. (Help wanted with [wiki:Software/DBusRemote better remote transports] - the transport mechanism is well-abstracted and extensible.)

The D-Bus [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus/api/html/index.html low-level API] and [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html protocol] have been heavily tested in the real world over several years, and are now "set in stone." Future changes will either be compatible or versioned appropriately.

The low-level libdbus library has no required dependencies; the bus daemon's only *required* dependency is an XML parser (either libxml or expat). Higher-level bindings specific to particular frameworks (Qt, GLib, Java, C#, Python, etc.) add more dependencies, but can make more assumptions and are thus much simpler to use. The bindings evolve separately from the low-level libdbus, so some are more mature and ABI-stable than others; check the docs for the binding you plan to use.

The [wiki:Software/DbusProjects list of projects using D-Bus] is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from.

D-Bus is very portable to any Linux or UNIX flavor, and a port to Windows is in progress.

If you have any trouble with D-Bus or suggestions for improvement, bug reports and comments are very welcome.

= Mailinglist =

All D-Bus discussion is currently on [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/ dbus@lists.freedesktop.org] (formerly message-bus-list''''''@freedesktop.org).


= Grab the Source =

== CVS ==

The [wiki:GettingInvolved CVS] module for this spec is "dbus". You can browse it with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/ ViewCVS].

CVS commits can be monitored on the [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus-commit/ dbus-commit] mailing list.

== GIT ==

Git is now being used for some of the language bindings in D-Bus.  There is a [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/UsingGit nice tutorial for using git with freedesktop.org projects].  There is also [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-git/ another tutorial at IBM Developerworks site].

= Reporting Bugs & Sending Patches =

Please report bugs (and submit patches) through the freedesktop.org [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ Bugzilla].

= Language Bindings =

Bindings have been split from the core.  Please visit the [wiki:Software/DBusBindings Bindings Page] to find out where you can get the latest bindings from.

= Documentation =

Some stuff from the doc/ subdirectory is prebuilt and browsable here. If you're new to D-Bus, the tutorial is
probably the best place to start (even though it is very incomplete, the basics are covered).

= Download =

== Core ==

The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.0.0.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0 "Blue Bird"]. (2006-11-09)

	* Documents updated with API/ABI guarantees
	* Added missing patch FreeBSD need to run out of the box
	* dbus-monitor now has a profile mode
	* AUTHORS file updated with names from the ChangeLog. Thanks to everyone who helped get us here

The previous release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-0.95.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0 RC 3 (dbus-0.95.tar.gz)]. (2006-11-03)

	* DBUS_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE no longer needs to be defined when building apps
	* ./configure checks now work when cross compiling
	* dbus-uuidgen --ensure is now run in the init script so there is no need to run it in a post script
	* dbus-uuidgen now writes out to /var/lib/dbus to work with systems that do not have a writable /etc. Packages should install and own the /var/lib/dbus directory
	* recursive locks are now used when dbus_threads_init_default is called
	* standard_session_servicedirs tag added to the session.conf under a normal build this specifies these service directories:
		/usr/local/share/dbus-1/services[[BR]]
		/usr/share/dbus-1/services[[BR]]
		$HOME/.local/share/dbus-1/services
	* fixed crash when a service directory is specified more than once
	* fixed a crash in *BSD when watching config directories for changes
	* fixed Irix build by using dirp->&#95;&#95;dd_fd to get the file descriptor
	* cleaned up the LOCAL_CREDS vs CMGCRED credential code so *BSD's don't crash here anymore
	* dbus_message_iter_get_array_len deprecated
	* cleanup-man-pages.sh added so packagers can clean up Doxygen man page output from 7 to 2 megs
	* large documentation improvements
	* numerous bug fixes
