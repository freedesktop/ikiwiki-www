= What is D-Bus? =

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, but TCP/IP option is available and [wiki:Software/DBusRemote remote support] planned.

The D-Bus API isn't finished yet, and the design is by no means set in stone. One of our main goals is for lots of projects to use it, so if you wouldn't use it, by all means mail us and say why - design, licensing, indentation style, we would rather know than not know.

D-Bus' only *required* dependency is an XML parser (either libxml or expat). D-Bus includes many language bindings to the D-Bus system, if you want to build those. The [wiki:Software/DbusProjects list of projects using D-Bus] is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from.

Trying out D-Bus in sample applications is encouraged - we want to get it widely used and tested. It should be working pretty well these days, and when it isn't bug reports are very welcome.

Get on D-Bus today!


= Mailinglist =

All D-Bus discussion is currently on [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/ dbus@lists.freedesktop.org] (formerly message-bus-list''''''@freedesktop.org).


= Grab the Source =

== CVS ==

The [wiki:GettingInvolved CVS] module for this spec is "dbus". You can browse it with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/ ViewCVS].

CVS commits can be monitored on the [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus-commit/ dbus-commit] mailing list.

== GIT ==

Git is now being used for some of the language bindings in D-Bus.  There is a [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/UsingGit nice tutorial for using git with freedesktop.org projects].  There is also [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-git/ another tutorial at IBM Developerworks site].

= Reporting Bugs & Sending Patches =

Please report bugs (and submit patches) through the freedesktop.org [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ Bugzilla].

= Language Bindings =

Bindings have been split from the core.  Please visit the [wiki:Software/DBusBindings Bindings Page] to find out where you can get the latest bindings from.

= Documentation =

Some stuff from the doc/ subdirectory is prebuilt and browsable here. If you're new to D-Bus, the tutorial is
probably the best place to start (even though it is very incomplete, the basics are covered).

== Core ==
The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-0.94.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0 RC 2 (dbus-0.94.tar.gz)]. (2006-10-14)

	* dbus-uuidgen binary added for future remote machine identification 
		* packagers should call dbus-uuidgen --ensure in their post
	* GetMachineId peer method added to the bus API
	* dbus_connection_set_route_peer_messages API added to let the bus send peer messages directly to an app
	* Autolaunch abilities added to dbus-launch with the --autolaunch flag
		* This feature allows libdbus to start a session bus if none can be found
  		* This is an internal feature and should not be used by scripts DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is still the correct way to specify a session bus
	* dbus-launch now prints out a simple key value pairs instead of shell scripts if one of the shell flags aren't used
	* support DBUS_BLOCK_ON_ABORT env variable to cause blocking waiting for gdb
	* weak ref are now held for shared connections so the right things happen this fixes some pretty major bugs with the way connections were handled
	* Some refactoring for Windows (doesn't effect Unix)
	* Solaris build fixes
	* MacOSX build fixes
	* Cross compile build fixes.  We now assume getpwnam_r is posix and va_lists can be copied by value since we can't check this in a cross compile.  If this is not true for a particular target is up to the developer to patch.
	* Bug fixing all around

The previous release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-0.93.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0 RC 1 (dbus-0.93.tar.gz)]. (2006-09-14)

	* dbus_threads_init_default added for initalizing threads without the need for bindings
	* Filters are now properly removed
	* dbus_connection_open now holds a hard ref to shared connections
	* We now print out a warning and do nothing when someone tries to close a shared connection
	* The --introspect switch has been added to the bus for printing out introspection data without actually running the bus
	* LOCAL_CREDS socket credentials are now supported for systems which support it such as NetBSD
	* Generalize kqueue support so it works with NetBSD as well as FreeBSD
	* Numerous bug fixes and memory leaks patched

Previous releases can be found in the [wiki:Software/DbusReleaseArchive release archive].

== Bindings ==

Bindings can be downloaded from the [wiki:Software/DBusBindings Bindings Page].

= Windows port =

Until the merge with the official D-Bus code, the Windows port is hosted on Sourceforge: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/windbus winDBus].
