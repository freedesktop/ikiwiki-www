= What is D-Bus? =
D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, or through unencrypted TCP/IP suitable for use behind a firewall with shared NFS home directories. (Help wanted with [:Software/DBusRemote:better remote transports] - the transport mechanism is well-abstracted and extensible.)

The D-Bus [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus/api/html/index.html low-level API] and [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html protocol] have been heavily tested in the real world over several years, and are now "set in stone." Future changes will either be compatible or versioned appropriately.

The low-level libdbus library has no required dependencies; the bus daemon's only *required* dependency is an XML parser (either libxml or expat). Higher-level bindings specific to particular frameworks (Qt, GLib, Java, C#, Python, etc.) add more dependencies, but can make more assumptions and are thus much simpler to use. The bindings evolve separately from the low-level libdbus, so some are more mature and ABI-stable than others; check the docs for the binding you plan to use.

The [:Software/DbusProjects:list of projects using D-Bus] is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from.

D-Bus is very portable to any Linux or UNIX flavor, and a port to Windows is in progress.

If you have any trouble with D-Bus or suggestions for improvement, bug reports and comments are very welcome.

= Mailinglist =
All D-Bus discussion is currently on [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/ dbus@lists.freedesktop.org] (formerly message-bus-list''''''@freedesktop.org).

= Grab the Source =
== CVS ==
The [:GettingInvolved:CVS] module for this spec is "dbus". You can browse it with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/ ViewCVS].

CVS commits can be monitored on the [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus-commit/ dbus-commit] mailing list.

== GIT ==
Git is now being used for some of the language bindings in D-Bus.  There is a [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/UsingGit nice tutorial for using git with freedesktop.org projects].  There is also [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-git/ another tutorial at IBM Developerworks site].

= Reporting Bugs & Sending Patches =
Please report bugs (and submit patches) through the freedesktop.org [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ Bugzilla].

= Language Bindings =
Bindings have been split from the core.  Please visit the [:Software/DBusBindings:Bindings Page] to find out where you can get the latest bindings from.

= Documentation =
Some stuff from the doc/ subdirectory is prebuilt and browsable here. If you're new to D-Bus, the tutorial is probably the best place to start (even though it is very incomplete, the basics are covered).

= Download =
== Core ==
The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.0.2.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0.2]. (2006-12-12)

 * Fix security bug CVE-2006-6107 match rules can be removed by apps that did not create them
 * pthread fix
The previous release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.0.1.tar.gz D-Bus 1.0.1]. (2006-11-17)

 * Fix bug where calling dbus_threads_init_default would assert
 * Fix UUID output to match the spec
 * Clear up documentation on UUIDs
Previous releases can be found in the [:Software/DbusReleaseArchive:release archive].

== Core Devel ==
The latest development release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.1.1.tar.gz D-Bus 1.1.2]. (2007-07-27)

 * This release is intended to be a feature complete beta for stable release 1.2.0, please test it. 1.2.0 will follow pretty soon if no major problems are found.  We'll do more betas if significant changes are made.
 * This is a development release, so API's may still change if problems are found (though we will try hard not to).
 * The system bus now supports starting services on demand. This uses a setuid helper program because system bus daemon runs as a nobody user, while services it launches may need to run as a different user. '''''Extra eyes auditing the setuid helper are encouraged and would be timely right now, before 1.2.0. '''''A design doc is available in doc/system-activation.txt
 * The TCP address format has been enhanced, such that TCP may be actually usable.  The dbus-daemon man page describes the new elements in the address format.  1.1.1 had added an all_interfaces flag to the format, which has been removed in favor of a cleaner approach.
 * Some thread-related bugs have been fixed, these are important fixes if you are using multiple threads with libdbus, and not important otherwise.
== Bindings ==
Bindings can be downloaded from the [:Software/DBusBindings:Bindings Page].

= Windows port =
Until the merge with the official D-Bus code, the Windows port is hosted on Sourceforge: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/windbus winDBus].
