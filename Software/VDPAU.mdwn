# VDPAU

VDPAU is the Video Decode and Presentation API for UNIX.  It provides an interface to video decode acceleration and presentation hardware present in modern GPUs. 


## Features

* Hardware decoding of MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 part 2, H.264, VC-1, and DivX 4 and 5 bitstreams on supported hardware, with a bitstream (VLD) level API. 
* Video post-processing including advanced deinterlacing algorithms, inverse telecine, noise reduction, configurable color space conversion, and procamp adjustments. 
* Sub-picture, on-screen display, and UI element compositing. 
* Direct rendering timestamp-based presentation of final video frames, with detailed frame delivery reports. 

## Documentation

Documentation for the API is stored in Doxygen comments in the VDPAU header files.  You can also read the [[generated HTML version|ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/vdpau/doxygen/html/index.html]]. 


## Code

The library used by applications that wish to use VDPAU is [[libvdpau|http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~aplattner/libvdpau/]].  This is a wrapper library that loads the appropriate implementation backend.  There is also a tracing library that can be used to debug VDPAU applications.
