== Available Releases ==

Tarballs are in [http://freedesktop.org/xapps/release/ here].

== Available Test Packages ==

	* Available from [http://freedesktop.org/~markh/xapps/] (broken link)

	* Currently available are test autotooled tarballs for '''xkbprogs''' and '''xtutilities'''.

=== CVS Availability ===

Please note that the CVS versions of the modular xapps are deprecated.  Instead, we have moved to using git.

'''NOTE:''' This only applies to the modular xapps, the actual development trees of the applications listed at the top of this page still use CVS.

=== GIT Availability ===

To obtain a copy of the git tree for these xapps, use the following:

{{{
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/app/PROJECT
}}}

`PROJECT` should be one of the following

	* `fdclock`
	* `xwininfo`
	* `xclock`
	* `xcompmgr`
	* etc..

See http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/ for all the available git repositories.

== Plans ==

	* [wiki:Software/ProposedAppsPackages Proposed package breakdown for sanity's sake].

	* [wiki:Software/ProposedXAppsCVSStructure Proposed xapps CVS structure] to make merging with xorg easy
