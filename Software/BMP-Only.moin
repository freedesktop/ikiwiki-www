This is a list of software that doesnï¿½t support non-[[Software/BMP| BMP]] Unicode characters. These characters include less-used Han characters, musical notation, historical scripts like Old Persian, and modern artificial scripts like Shavian.

	* [[http://www.vim.org/|VIM]]: Supplementary characters are handled cleanly, but displayed as question marks.
	* [[http://www.antlr.org/|ANTLR]]: Does not accept supplementary characters in input files.
