This is a list of software that doesnï¿½t support non-[:Software/BMP: BMP] Unicode characters. These characters include less-used Han characters, musical notation, historical scripts like Old Persian, and modern artificial scripts like Shavian.

	* [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html Emacs]: Supplementary characters are displayed as occurrences of U+FFFD. Attempting to delete them [http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2004-04/msg00164.html leaves corruption].
	* [http://www.vim.org/ VIM]: Supplementary characters are handled cleanly, but displayed as question marks.
