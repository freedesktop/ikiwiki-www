## Fontconfig

Fontconfig is a library for configuring and customizing font access. 


### About Fontconfig

Fontconfig can: 

                     * discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common source of configuration problems. 
                     * perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative fonts can be selected if fonts are missing. 
                     * identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of languages. 
                     * have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based configuration file (though with autodiscovery, we believe this need is minimized). 
                     * efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among the set of fonts you have installed, even if you have installed thousands of fonts, while minimzing memory usage. 
                     * be used in concert with the X Render Extension and [[FreeType|FreeType]] to implement high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a display. 
Fontconfig does not: 

                     * render the fonts themselves (this is left to [[FreeType|FreeType]] or other rendering mechanisms) 
                     * depend on the X Window System in any fashion, so that printer only applications do not have such dependencies
