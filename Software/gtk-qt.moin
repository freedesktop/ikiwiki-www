== GTK-Qt Theme Engine ==

The GTK-Qt Theme Engine is a project allowing GTK to use Qt widget styles.

It behaves like a normal GTK theme engine, but calls functions from Qt instead of doing the drawing itself.


=== CVS ===

The [[Main.GettingInvolved][CVS]] module for this engine is "gtk-qt"

To get the latest code from CVS, do the following:
{{{
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@freedesktop.org:/cvs/gtk-qt login
CVS password: <hit return>
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@freedesktop.org:/cvs/gtk-qt co gtk-qt-engine
}}}

You can also browse the CVS repository online with [http://pdx.freedesktop.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gtk-qt/ Web  CVS]

=== Installation instructions ===

Installing the theme is simple.  There is no need to use the --prefix option when running configure, as everything should be automatically detected.

You must issue these commands to compile the theme engine:
{{{
./configure
make
su
make install
}}}

If you're using the CVS version, remember to run "make -f Makefile.cvs" first.

Users of *Mandrake* or *Debian* may need to run update-menus after everything is installed.

To tell GTK to use the new theme engine, run "GTK styles and fonts" from the KDE control center.

=== Binary packages ===

*Debian* unstable/sid users can put the following line in their /etc/apt/sources.list file
{{{
deb http://www.kalyxo.org/debian/ unstable main
}}}

The engine is [http://autopackage.org/ Autopackage] ready, but no files will be made available until [http://autopackage.org/ Autopackage] 1.0 is released.

=== Using the theme from inside GNOME ===

Due to an incompatibility between Qt and the GNOME window manager, some parts of GNOME will not be themed by Qt.

The theme will run fine under GNOME, but the logout box and window border menus will appear blank.

It appears that the only way to overcome this bug is by patching Qt itself.
