== GTK-Qt Theme Engine ==

The GTK-Qt Theme Engine is a project allowing GTK to use Qt widget styles.

It behaves like a normal GTK theme engine, but calls functions from Qt instead of doing the drawing itself.


== Downloads ==

'''Latest version'''
 * [http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidsansome/gtk-qt-engine-0.6.tar.bz2 Version 0.6: Source code]
 * [http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidsansome/gtk-qt-engine-0.6-3.x86.package Version 0.6: Autopackage binary] ([http://www.autopackage.org/docs/howto-install/ instructions])

Older versions are available [http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidsansome/ here]

'''Debian package'''

While there is a package included in '''Debian''', newer versions can be obtained by putting the following line in /etc/apt/sources.list
{{{
deb http://archive.kalyxo.org/kalyxo/ staging main
}}}


== Installation instructions ==

Installing the theme is simple.  There is no need to use the --prefix option when running configure, as everything should be automatically detected.

You must issue these commands to compile the theme engine:
{{{
./configure
make
su
make install
}}}

'''Mandrake''' users may need to run update-menus after everything is installed.

To tell GTK to use the new theme engine, run "GTK styles and fonts" from the KDE control center.


== CVS ==

The CVS module for this engine is "gtk-qt"

To get the latest code from CVS, do the following:
{{{
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@freedesktop.org:/cvs/gtk-qt login
CVS password: <hit return>
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@freedesktop.org:/cvs/gtk-qt co gtk-qt-engine
}}}

You can also browse the CVS repository online with [http://cvs.freedesktop.org/gtk-qt/ Web CVS]


== Using the theme from inside GNOME ==

Due to an incompatibility between Qt and the GNOME window manager, some parts of GNOME will not be themed by Qt.

The theme will run fine under GNOME, but the logout box and window border menus will appear blank.

It appears that the only way to overcome this bug is by patching Qt itself.
