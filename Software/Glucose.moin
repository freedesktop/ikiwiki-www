= Glucose =

In the spirit of being short and sweet, that fits very well with the concepts of Glucose:
 * it's an OpenGL based acceleration architecture (as XAA and EXA);
 * it uses ["Software/Xgl"] code, so it accelerates everything using exactly the same paths as ["Software/Xgl"] does, so there's no duplicate code/work;
 * all driver code is limited to just initialising it (a call to '''glucoseDriverInit''').

== Known issues ==

 * Xorg will crash if the number of clients reaches zero.
 * Changes to the screen geometry via RandR extension are not yet supported.

== Source ==

Source is only available from Git and for Intel cards. You need to follow the [http://www.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide instructions to build a modular Xorg], but using instead:
 * ''yuv-porting'' branch from ''pixman'' module,
 * ''master'' of ["Software/glitz"] module,
 * ''glucose-2'' branch from ''xserver'' module,
 * ''glucose'' branch from ''xf86-video-intel'' module.

Then add the following line to the ''Device'' section of you '''xorg.conf'':
{{{
  Option  "AccelMethod"  "glucose"
}}}
