## Standard Type Services Framework

** Note that work on this project ceased in 2005 and most of the previous sources are gone or no longer functional. **

Standard Type Services Framework (STSF) is  a text imaging and font handling framework for application developers. It is portable across different platforms and graphic systems. 

Due to its layered design, STSF can be easily integrated into any graphics environment. An STSF binding for the X Window System implementation is available in the STSF-CURRENT branch of the  xorg tree.
