== xdg-user-dirs ==

xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories 
like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles localization (i.e. 
translation) of the filenames.

The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the login 
phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of default 
directories. It then creates localized versions of these directories in the
users home directory and sets up a config file in $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs
(XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config) that applications can read to find these 
directories.

== Settings ==
Sysadmins can configure things by editing /etc/xdg/user-dirs.conf. At the moment there
are only two settings, you can disable the whole thing, and you can specify the 
charset encoding used for filenames. They can also set or change the default directories
and their initial values in /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults.

$(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs specifies the current set of directories for the user.
This file is in a shell format, so its easy to access from a shell script. This
file can also be modified by users (manually or via applications) to change the directories
used. Note: To disable a directory, point it to the homedir. If you delete it it will be recreated
on the next login.

Here is a shellscript example of how to find the desktop and the download directory: {{{
test -f ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/user-dirs.dirs && source ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/user-dirs.dirs
echo ${XDG_DESKTOP_DIR:-$HOME/Desktop}
echo ${XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR:-$HOME}
}}}

For application code the hope is that the various desktops will integrate this and have a nice
API to find these directories.

               This isn't recommended (as it can cause problems with e.g. shared
               homedirs on multiple machines), but can be useful at times.
