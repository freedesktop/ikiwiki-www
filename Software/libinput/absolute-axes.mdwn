libinput supports three types of devices with absolute axes:

* multi-touch screens
* single-touch screens
* graphics tablets (currently WIP)

A special case of absolute devices are touchpads. While technically absolute devices, the axis values are converted to delta motion and posted as relative events.

For all absolute devices, the default unit for x/y coordinates is in mm off the top left corner on the device, or more specifically off the device's sensor.

## Why x/y coordinates are not normalized

x/y are not given in normalized coordinates ([0..1]) for one simple reason: the aspect ratio of virtually all current devices is something other than 1:1. A normalized axes thus is only useful when looking at a single point at the time, and even then it can only tell that the stylus is e.g. at 78% from the left, 34% from the top of the device. Without knowing the per-axis resolution, these numbers are meaningless. Worse and calculation based on previous coordinates is simply wrong: a movement from 0/0 to 50%/50% is not a 45% degree line.

This could be alleviated by providing resolution and information about the aspect ratio to the caller. Which shifts processing and likely errors into the caller for little benefit. Providing the x/y axes in mm from the outset removes these errors.
