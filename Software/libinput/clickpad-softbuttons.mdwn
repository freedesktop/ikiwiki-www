[[!meta title="Clickpad Software Button behavior"]]

Clickpad is the name given to touchpads without physical buttons below the
touchpad. Instead, the whole touchpad acts as a button and left or right button clicks are distinguished by the location and/or number of fingers on the touchpad.
["ClickPad" is a term coined by Synaptics Inc.](http://www.synaptics.com/en/clickpad.php) but for simplicity we refer to any touchpad with the above feature as Clickpad, regardless of the manufacturer.

A clickpad is always marked with the INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property. Note that
there is a type of clickpads that have the top section marked as software
buttons as well. See [[Lenovo *40 series touchpad support|/Software/libinput/t440-support]] for details on the top software button.

To perform a right-click on a Clickpad, two methods are available in libinput:

* on Apple touchpads, a right click is performed by two fingers on the touchpad while clicking, a behavior termed "clickfinger"
* on non-Apple touchpads, a right click is performed by a finger in a software-defined right button area


The button behavior depends on the hardware. Some Clickpads, notably
some Cypress ones, perform right button detection in firmware and appear to
userspace as if the touchpad had physical buttons. While physically clickpads,
these are not handled by the software and treated like traditional touchpads.

The clickfinger behavior is subject to some restrictions:

* two fingers execute a right click, three fingers a middle click
* The Xorg synaptics driver uses 30% of the touchpad dimensions as threshold, libinput does not have this restrictions. If two fingers are on the pad while clicking, that is a two-finger click.
* clickfinger behavior is only enabled on Apple touchpads


The button behavior is subject to some restrictions:

The button area is usually defined like this:

    +------------------------+
    |                        |
    |                        |
    |          MAIN          |
    |          AREA          |
    |                        |
    +------------------------+
    |    LEFT    |   RIGHT   |
    +------------------------+

The size of the buttons is hardware dependent.

* if fingers are only down in the main area, a left click is generated
* if a finger is in the right area when the physical click happens, a right click is generated
* if fingers are in both the left and right area, a middle click is generated
* fingers in the main area are not considered for right or middle click generation
* if a finger starts in the main area, the software buttons do not apply to that finger 
* a finger in the software button area does not move the pointer, but once it moves out of the button area it will control the pointer (if it's the first finger to do so)
* once a finger has moved out of the button area, it cannot move back in and trigger a right/middle button click
* a release event releases the buttons logically down, regardless of the current finger position
