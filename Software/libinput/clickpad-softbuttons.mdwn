[[!meta title="Clickpad Software Button behavior"]]

Clickpad is the name given to touchpads without physical buttons below the
touchpad. Instead, the whole touchpad acts as a button and left or right button clicks are distinguished by the location and/or number of fingers on the touchpad.
["ClickPad" is a term coined by Synaptics Inc.](http://www.synaptics.com/en/clickpad.php) but for simplicity we refer to any touchpad with the above feature as Clickpad, regardless of the manufacturer.

A clickpad is always marked with the INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property.

To perform a right-click on a Clickpad, two methods are prominent:

* on Apple touchpads, a right click is performed by two fingers on the touchpad while clicking, termed "clickfinger"
* on most non-Apple touchpads, a right click is performed by a finger in the right button area

The button area is usually defined like this:

    +------------------------+
    |                        |
    |                        |
    |          LEFT          |
    |                        |
    |                        |
    +------------------------+
    |    LEFT    |   RIGHT   |
    +------------------------+


The button behavior depends on the implementation. Some Clickpads, notably
some Cypress ones, perform right button detection in firmware and appear to
userspace as if the touchpad had physical buttons. While physically clickpads,
these are not handled by the software and treated like traditional touchpads.


The clickfinger behavior is subject to some restrictions:

* two fingers execute a right click, three fingers a middle click
* the two fingers must be in relative proximity. The Xorg synaptics driver uses 30% of the touchpad dimensions as threshold.
* some touchpads only support two touchpoints, with additional fingers being sent as BTN_TOOL_TRIPLETAP, etc.
