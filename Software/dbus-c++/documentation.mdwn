### Basic type mappings

**Hint:** Please someone with knowlegde should add that to a table. I'm going crazy with that Wiki. 

Variant ==> "v" Byte ==> "y" Bool ==> "b" Int16 ==> "n" UInt16 ==> "q" Int32 ==> "i" UInt32 ==> "u" Int64 ==> "x" UInt64 ==> "t" Double ==> "d" String ==> "s" Path ==> "o" Signature ==> "g" Invalid ==> ""
