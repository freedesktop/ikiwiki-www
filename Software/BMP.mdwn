Since Unicode 2.0, the authors of the Unicode Standard noticed that the original 65,536 characters are not adequate for the modern needs of information processing ([[Han|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese]] characters were proving to be too many, if one considered the rarely-used characters). 

To handle this,  they extended the upper limit of Unicode from U+FFFF to U+10FFFF, thereby introducing more than a million new character slots. The authors of the Unicode Standard, guessing many people will take a little time to change the architecture of their software to support the full repertoire of Unicode, only encoded characters of less frequent use (like rarely-used Han characters, older scripts, or musical notation) in that area. 

The range U+0000 to U+FFFF, where more important characters are stored, is called the Basic Multilingual Plane, while the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF is divided into 16 planes, only three of which have so far been used to encode characters.
