## X Window Information

X Window Information is a window information utility for developers of applications, toolkits, and window managers.  X Window Information follows your pointer providing information about the windows below. Information presented includes: 

                     * A detailed description of the window hierarchy below the pointer. 
                     * Parsed interpretations of standard properties from both the application window and the window manager. 
                     * Information about X server resources used by the application. 
X Window Information requires Gtk+-2 and an X server supporting the X-Resource extension.
