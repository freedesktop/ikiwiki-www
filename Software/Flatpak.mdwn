Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.

Each application uses a specified "runtime", which is available
as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application bundles
with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within the
same desktop environment.
