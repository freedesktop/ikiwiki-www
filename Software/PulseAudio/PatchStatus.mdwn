# Patch status

This page tracks the status of submitted patches that haven't been merged yet. The contents are updated once a week, or that's the goal anyway. If you have submitted a patch more than a week ago, and you think it should be listed here but it's not, then please contact the maintainers (we might have missed your patch).
