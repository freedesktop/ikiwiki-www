# Documentation

PulseAudio is an important part of Linux plumbing. As such documentation falls broadly into two primary categories: documentation for users who want to configure their systems to their own personal tastes and documentation for developers wanting to work on or with PulseAudio. For distribution packagers, the information you will need is mostly encompassed by the user documentation although it would make sense to familiarise yourself with at least the debugging sections of the developer documentation.

The maintainer documentation includes documentation of our internal processes related to maintaining PulseAudio.
