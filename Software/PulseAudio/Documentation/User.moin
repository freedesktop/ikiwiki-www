If you are new to !PulseAudio, consider reading about the [wiki:FirstSteps first steps].

== The Perfect Setup ==

After doing your first steps with !PulseAudio you might want to know everything about [wiki:PerfectSetup the perfect setup].

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Before asking for help on the [wiki:Community#MailingLists mailing lists] or on [wiki:Community#IRC IRC] make sure to consult our [wiki:FAQ list of frequently asked questions].

== Modules ==

!PulseAudio has whole bunch of loadable modules, each with its own set of functions and parameters. See the [wiki:Modules modules] page for a description of them all.

== Command Line Interface ==

The !PulseAudio daemon can be configured with its own [wiki:CLI command line language].

== Daemon ==

Read all about the [wiki:Daemon daemon's command line parameters].

== Server Strings ==

The syntax of server address strings understood by !PulseAudio are documented [wiki:ServerStrings here].

== Running !PulseAudio as System-Wide Daemon ==

In some setups it might be sensible to [wiki:SystemWideInstance run PulseAudio as system-wide daemon] instead of per-user.

== Authentication ==
!PulseAudio clients can be required to authenticate them to the server they try to connect to. This can be done by cookie files, or if the native protocol is used on unix and the daemon runs in system-wide mode, by group permissions. The module module-simple-protocol-{unix,tcp} is is always open for all clients.[[BR]]

IP-based access control lists can be used, by giving certain modules arguments starting with "auth-ip-acl=" as showed on other documentation pages like [wiki:FAQ] and [wiki:Modules].
