= The Format of Server Strings =

A server string contains information how to contact a !PulseAudio server. You can specify it via ''$PULSE_SERVER'' or as first argument to ''pa_context_new()'' or ''pa_simple_new()''. Normally it should be OK to leave it alone, but sometimes it is necessary to specify your own.

The server string is a space-seperated list of server addresses. A server address is parsed according the following rules:

 1. If it starts with a string enclosed in '''{}''' the address string is ignored unless the local hostname equals the string in the '''{}'''. Otherwise this prefix is skipped.
 1. If the string starts with '''/''' or '''unix:''' the remaining address string is taken as UNIX socket name.
 1. If the string starts with '''tcp4:''' or '''tcp:''' the remaining address string is split at the next colon, the first part is taken as hostname/IP address for IPv4, the second part as port number. If no colon is specified the default port number is assumed and the full remaining string is used as hostname/IP address.
 1. If the string starts with '''tcp6:''' a similar rule applies, but this time for IPv6
 1. Otherwise a similar rule applies, but it is left to the resolver whether IPv4 or IPv6 is used for the connection.

An example string:

{{{
{ecstasy}unix:/tmp/pulse-lennart/native tcp6:ecstasy.ring2.lan:4713 tcp:ecstasy.ring2.lan:4713
}}}

This tells !PulseAudio to connect to the UNIX socket ''/tmp/pulse-lennart/native'' if the local host name is ''ecstasy''. If that fails (or the hostname doesn't match) try to connect to host ''ecstasy.ring2.lan'' on port 4713 usng TCP/IPv6. If even that fails, connect to the same host/port with TCP/IPv4.
