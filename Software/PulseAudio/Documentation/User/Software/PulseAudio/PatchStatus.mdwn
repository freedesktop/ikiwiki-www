* When Speex is compiled with FIXED_POINT defined, it scales float input to +/-32768 instead of +/-1. But Pulseaudio invokes speex float method with input in range of +/-1. So in order to make floating point resamplers work with Speex compiled with FIXED_POINT, we need to rescale the input to Speex.
