# Bluetooth

## Introduction

The Bluetooth standard specifies three audio profiles:

* "A2DP" (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) - high-quality audio playback, appropriate for e.g. listening to music.
* "HSP" (HeadSet Profile) - phone-quality audio playback and recording, appropriate for phone calls.
* "HFP" (Hands-Free Profile) - same as HSP, but with additional functionality for managing phone calls.

Each of the profiles are further divided into two roles:

* A2DP:
  * Source role - the device that sends audio. When PulseAudio acts in this role, a sink is created where applications can play to (this may be confusing - when PulseAudio acts as a bluetooth "source", a sink is created and vice versa).
  * Sink role - the device that receives audio. When PulseAudio acts in this role, a source is created where applications can record from.
* HSP:
  * TODO
* HFP:
  * TODO

(TODO: rewrite this paragraph) On Linux, PulseAudio supports all of these profiles. However, the HSP and HFP implementations are mutually exclusive - it depends on the configuration which profile is enabled (there's no fundamental reason why they have to be mutually exclusive - that's just how it is at the moment). HSP is enabled by default.

PulseAudio depends on [[BlueZ|http://www.bluez.org]] for all Bluetooth functionality, and additionally [[oFono|https://01.org/ofono]] is required for HFP support.

## Configuration

A2DP and HSP should work out-of-the-box. Just pair and connect the device, and a new audio device should appear in PulseAudio.

### HFP

To enable HFP (which also disables HSP support), change this line in /etc/pulse/default.pa

    load-module module-bluetooth-discover

to

    load-module module-bluetooth-discover headset=ofono

Then restart PulseAudio.

    TODO: oFono may need configuration changes too.
