== Patches & Bugs ==

'''Bugs''' are reported by creating a [/newticket new ticket]. But first make sure that the bug isn't already [/report/1 listed]. Because of heavy spamming, you have to be logged in to create and modify tickets. Registration is a simple matter of choosing a user name. An email address is not required. However, if you do specify an email address you will be notified about ticket changes. Click on the top right [/register Register button] to create a user now. 

'''Patches''' are preferably submitted as new tickets with the patch as an attachment but may also be sent to the mailing list. Before submitting patches please read through our [wiki:CodingStyle coding style guidelines].

Alternatively send patches or bug reports directly to ''mzchyfr [at] 0pointer [dot] net''.
