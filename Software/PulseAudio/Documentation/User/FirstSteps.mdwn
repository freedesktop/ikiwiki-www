# First Steps

Simply start the PulseAudio daemon with the argument `-nC`:

    pulseaudio -nC

This will present you a screen like this:

    Welcome to PulseAudio! Use "help" for usage information.
    >>>

Now you can issue CLI commands as described [[here|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/CLI]]. If you already have `pulseaudio` started use pacmd command to open the CLI. Another way to start `pulseaudio` is by specifying a configuration script like that one included in the distribution on the command line:

    pulseaudio -nF pulseaudio.pa

This will load some drivers and protocols automatically.

The best idea is to configure your daemon in `/etc/pulse/daemon.conf` and `/etc/pulse/default.pa` and to run `pulseaudio` without any arguments.

**Beware! ** Unless you pass the option `--sysconfdir=/etc` to `configure`, the directory `/etc/pulse/` is really `/usr/local/etc/pulse/`.

More information about available arguments and signals for the daemon can be found [[here|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Daemon]].
