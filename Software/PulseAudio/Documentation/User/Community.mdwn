## Bugs, Patches & Translations

**Bugs** are reported at [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/issues]]. There might be a chance that the bug you want to report is not actually one. For those we have prepared a list of **[[canned responses|CannedResponses]]**. Please check this list before filing a bug because otherwise you might find your bug closed quickly with a reference to one of the items of that list.

**Important:** If you are encountering a **crash**, please make sure to provide a **stack trace** when you file a bug. That requires installing "debug symbols" for PulseAudio and its libraries. The various distributions usually provide documentation how you do this best.  Here are the guides for [[Fedora|http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/StackTraces]], [[Mandriva|http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Development/Howto/Software_Crash]] and [[Ubuntu|https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Backtrace]].

Arch doesn't have a simple way to install debug symbols, but you can install the pulseaudio-git and libpulse-git packages from heftig's repo, instructions [[here|https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=117157]]. Those replace the "official" pulseaudio packages with ones that include the very newest code from upstream, and the packages happen to include the debug symbols in them.

Also, make sure to include the verbose output of PA when this problem happens.

### Running PulseAudio manually

First, you might need to stop your existing daemon. If your system uses systemd to manage user sessions, you can just do a "systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.{socket,service}".

If you're not using systemd, you might need to stop a running PA first by issuing "pulseaudio -k". If autospawning is enabled (which it now is by default) you might have to race against it when restarting PA, so it might be a good idea to issue "pulseaudio -k ; pulseaudio -vvvvv" in a single command and try a few times. Usually that should work well enough to win the race. If it doesn't, adding "autospawn=no" to ~/.config/pulse/client.conf will disable autospawning. Removing that line (or that file) will restore your default autospawn behaviour.

Now, you can run "pulseaudio -vvvvv" in a terminal and try to reproduce your issue. 

**Important:** If you are using **Ubuntu** [[please read this before filing a bug|https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems]].

Below is a rough outline of how a stack trace can be acquired with gdb:

    $ LD_BIND_NOW=1 gdb pulseaudio
    >> run -vvvvv
    >> ...
    >> *** crash ***
    >> thread apply all bt full
    >> ...
    >> *** etc. etc. ***

Before posting a bug report you might want to check [[this list of broken ALSA sound drivers|Software/PulseAudio/Backends/ALSA/BrokenDrivers]]. (might be out of date)

If you have an issue with PulseAudio's **mixer handling**, [[read this first|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/PulseAudioStoleMyVolumes]]. If you have an issue with **memory consumption** [[read this first|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/MemoryConsumption]]. If you feel that that PA doesn't honour your **default device** choices, [[read this first|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/DefaultDevice]]. Other **canned responses** [[you find in this list|CannedResponses]].

**Patches** are preferably submitted as a [[Gitlab Merge Request|https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/merge_requests]] (this is equivalent to Pull Requests on Github, if you are familiar with those. If not, refer to the [[Gitlab documentation|https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html]]. Before submitting patches please read through our [[coding style guidelines|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/CodingStyle]].

**Translations** should be submitted via [[Fedora's Weblate|https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/pulseaudio/]] (we're not otherwise affiliated with Fedora, but they offered to host the translation service for us).


## Patch Review Status

We track the submitted patches [[here|https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/project/pulseaudio/patches/]]. That page is updated automatically with submissions to the mailing list. If you have submitted a patch, and you're waiting for someone to review it, it should be listed on that page. If it's not, then we have missed your patch, in which case please contact the maintainers (for example by sending a mail to the mailing list).
