# Git Branches

The development happens in the `master` branch. Major releases (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 etc.) are made from the `master` branch too, so while preparing for a release, the `master` branch is frozen. During the freeze, a temporary branch called `next` is created. Patches that aren't important for the upcoming release go to the `next` branch until the release is finished and `master` is unfrozen. After the release the patches in the `next` branch are rebased on `master` and the `next` branch is deleted.

Sometimes, if serious bugs have slipped into major releases, we may make bugfix releases too. These are made from separate branches, for example `stable-1.x`, `stable-2.x`, `stable-3.x`...
