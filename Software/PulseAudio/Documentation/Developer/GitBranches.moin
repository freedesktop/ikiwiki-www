The development happens in the '''master''' branch. Major releases (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 etc.) are made from the master branch too, so while preparing for a release, the master branch is frozen (development may continue in unofficial repositories during the freezes). Sometimes, if serious bugs have slipped into major releases, we may make bugfix releases too. These are made from separate branches, for example stable-1.x, stable-2.x, stable-3.x...
