= Interface of `pa_core` =

From [http://www.pulseaudio.org/browser/branches/lennart/src/pulsecore/core.h pulsecore/core.h]: "The core structure of !PulseAudio. Every !PulseAudio daemon contains exactly one of these. It is used for storing kind of global variables for the daemon."

`pa_core` doesn't have any interesting functions associated with it, it is just a central collection of all the components and globally relevant variables. The variables are managed by the daemon, so you shouldn't modify them yourself.
