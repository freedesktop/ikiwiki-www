# Checklist

Things to look at and update for a release:

* Bump sonames apparently for libpulse, etc.
* Update the NEWS file (for stable releases)
* git push master:master
* Make a signed tag, run make dist(check), test the tarball
* git push vX.Y:vX.Y
* Send out release announcement
* Update: PA home page, IRC topic, release notes (with git shortlog)
* Spread the word
* Sit back and fret about what it is that you're forgetting

# The Plan

This schedule is a guideline to keep a set of rolling releases rather than a longer cycle with lots of changes in between. 

* All releases happen off the master branch, and are numbered as N.0 
* If a release introduces a major bugs/regressions that need immediate attention, a stable-N.x branch is created and point releases in that series (N.1, N.2, ...) are made off this branch 
* Major releases are planned to be made every 4 months 
* A feature freeze will be announced ~2-4 weeks before the release, depending on how large the changes that have gone into the release are 
* Periodic release candidate tarballs will be rolled out during the freeze period for easy packaging and testing 
* World domination is targeted for December 2012
