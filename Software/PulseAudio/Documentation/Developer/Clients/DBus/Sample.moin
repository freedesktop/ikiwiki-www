=== Properties ===

==== Index ====

 * Type: Uint32
 * Access: read

The sample index.


==== Name ====

 * Type: String
 * Access: read

The sample name.


==== !SampleFormat ====

 * Type: Uint32
 * Access: read

The sample format of the sample (try not to get confused, the two "samples" in that sentence referred to different things). See [wiki:DBusInterface/Enumerations#Sampleformats] for the list of possible values.


==== !SampleRate ====

 * Type: Uint32
 * Access: read

The sample rate of the sample.


==== Channels ====

 * Type: [Uint32]
 * Access: read

The channel map of the sample. The channel count can be inferred from this. The channel map is expressed as a list of channel positions, see [wiki:DBusInterface/Enumerations#Channelpositions] for the list of possible channel position values.


==== !DefaultVolume ====

 * Type: [Uint32]
 * Access: read

The default volume of the sample. The volume elements in the array match the channel positions in the Stream interface's Channels property array.


==== Duration ====

 * Type: Uint64
 * Access: read

The duration of the sample in microseconds.


==== Bytes ====

 * Type: Uint32
 * Access: read

The length of the sample in bytes.


==== !PropertyList ====

 * Type: {String -> [Byte]}
 * Access: read

The sample's property list.



=== Methods ===

==== Play ====

 * Arguments: sink : !ObjectPath, volume : [Uint32], property_list : {String -> [Byte]}
   - sink: The sink through which the sample shall be played
   - volume: The volume with which to play the sample. The values must match the sample channels, or alternatively you can give an empty array, in which case the server decides the volume (this is often a good choice).
   - property_list: Additional properties to use when playing the sample. This can also be used to override existing properties.

Plays the sample.


==== Remove ====

Removes the sample from the sample cache.



=== Signals ===

==== !PropertyListUpdated ====

 * Parameters: property_list : {String -> [Byte]}
   - property_list: The new property list

The sample's property list was modified.
