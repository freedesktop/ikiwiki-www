== Device states ==

 * 0 : Running, the device is being used by at least one non-corked stream.
 * 1 : Idle, the device is active, but no non-corked streams are connected to it.
 * 2 : Suspended, the device is not in use and may be currently closed.


== Update modes ==

 * 0 : Replace the entire set with the new set, don't keep any old data around.
 * 1 : Merge the new set into the existing one, not replacing any old entries if they share a common key with the new set.
 * 2 : Merge the new set into the existing one, replacing all old entries that share a common key with the new set.
