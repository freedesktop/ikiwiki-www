Objects and their interfaces:

=== Properties ===

==== Index ====

 * Type: Uint32
 * Access: read

The client index.


==== Driver ====

 * Type: String
 * Access: read

The driver that implements the client object. This is usually expressed as a source code file name, for example "protocol-native.c".


==== !OwnerModule ====

 * Type: !ObjectPath
 * Access: read

The module that owns this client object. It's not guaranteed that any module claims ownership; in such case this property does not exist.

 * Errors:
   - [[Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/DBus/Errors#org.PulseAudio.Core1.NoSuchPropertyError|org.PulseAudio.Core1.NoSuchPropertyError]] if this client is not owned by any module.


==== !PlaybackStreams ====

 * Type: [!ObjectPath]
 * Access: read

The playback streams created by this client.


==== !RecordStreams ====

 * Type: [!ObjectPath]
 * Access: read

The record streams created by this client.


==== !PropertyList ====

 * Type: {String -> [Byte]}
 * Access: read

The client's property list.



=== Methods ===

==== Kill ====

Cut the client's connection, terminating also its streams.


==== !UpdateProperties ====

 * Arguments: property_list : {String -> [Byte]}, update_mode : Uint32
   - property_list: The properties to update
   - update_mode: How the properties should be merged, see [[Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/DBus/Enumerations#Updatemodes|[[Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/DBus/Enumerations|D Bus Interface →  Enumerations]]]] for the list of possible values

Updates the client's property list with new values. A client can modify only its own property list.

 * Errors:
   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.!AccessDenied if a client tries to modify some other client's property list.


==== !RemoveProperties ====

 * Arguments: keys : [String]
   - keys: Array of property names

Removes properties from the client's property list. A client can modify only its own property list.

 * Errors:
   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.!AccessDenied if a client tries to modify some other client's property list.



=== Signals ===

==== !PropertyListUpdated ====

 * Parameters: property_list : {String -> [Byte]}
   - property_list: The new property list

The client's property list was modified.


==== !ClientEvent ====

 * Parameters: name : String, property_list : {String -> [Byte]}
   - name: Event name
   - property_list: Additional event parameters

The server may send per-client events (visible only to the client that is the intended recipient). However, currently no such events are generated, so until some events are actually defined this signal remains unused.
