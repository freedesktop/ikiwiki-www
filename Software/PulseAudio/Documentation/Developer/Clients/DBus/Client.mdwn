# D-Bus Interface: Clients

[[(Back to the toplevel D-Bus Interface page)|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/DBus]] 

Objects and their interfaces: 

* /org/pulseaudio/core1/clientX 
      * - org.PulseAudio.Core1.Client - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties - org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable 

## org.PulseAudio.Core1.Client


### Properties


#### Index

* Type: Uint32 
* Access: read 
The client index. 


#### Driver

* Type: String 
* Access: read 
The driver that implements the client object. This is usually expressed as a source code file name, for example "protocol-native.c". 


#### !OwnerModule

* Type: ObjectPath 
* Access: read 
The module that owns this client object. It's not guaranteed that any module claims ownership; in such case this property does not exist. 

* Errors: 
      * - [[org.PulseAudio.Core1.NoSuchPropertyError|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/DBus/Errors]] if this client is not owned by any module. 

#### !PlaybackStreams

* Type: [ObjectPath] 
* Access: read 
The playback streams created by this client. 


#### !RecordStreams

* Type: [ObjectPath] 
* Access: read 
The record streams created by this client. 


#### !PropertyList

* Type: {String -> [Byte]} 
* Access: read 
The client's property list. 


### Methods


#### Kill

Cut the client's connection, terminating also its streams. 


#### !UpdateProperties

* Arguments: property_list : {String -> [Byte]}, update_mode : Uint32 
      * - property_list: The properties to update - update_mode: How the properties should be merged, see [[[[Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/DBus/Enumerations|Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/DBus/Enumerations]]]] for the list of possible values 
Updates the client's property list with new values. A client can modify only its own property list. 

* Errors: 
      * - org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied if a client tries to modify some other client's property list. 

#### !RemoveProperties

* Arguments: keys : [String] 
      * - keys: Array of property names 
Removes properties from the client's property list. A client can modify only its own property list. 

* Errors: 
      * - org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied if a client tries to modify some other client's property list. 

### Signals


#### !PropertyListUpdated

* Parameters: property_list : {String -> [Byte]} 
      * - property_list: The new property list 
The client's property list was modified. 


#### !ClientEvent

* Parameters: name : String, property_list : {String -> [Byte]} 
      * - name: Event name - property_list: Additional event parameters 
The server may send per-client events (visible only to the client that is the intended recipient). However, currently no such events are generated, so until some events are actually defined this signal remains unused.
