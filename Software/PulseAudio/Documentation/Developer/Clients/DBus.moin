= PulseAudio's D-Bus interface =

These pages should eventually contain the final D-Bus control interface specification. Currently it's just a draft, comments welcome.

Note: Whenever "user bus" is mentioned in these pages, it means "session bus" until the user bus gets implemented in D-Bus.

== Overview ==

Previously the only D-Bus services !PulseAudio provided were an implementation of the [http://git.0pointer.de/?p=reserve.git;a=blob_plain;f=reserve.txt Device Reservation spec] for sound cards and reservation of the org.pulseaudio.Server name on the session or system bus for server tracking purposes. Those features remain untouched, and this document doesn't have anything to do with them.

The new functionality consists of two parts: a server lookup service and the main control interface. When clients want to use the control interface, they have to first figure out where they should connect to. How to connect to the control interface is specified on the [wiki:DBusInterface/ConnectingToServer ConnectingToServer] page. The main control interface is provided as a server. That is, it's not available on any bus, but instead clients make direct connections to !PulseAudio.


== Control API ==

The detailed descriptions are spread to separate pages, roughly one per object type.
