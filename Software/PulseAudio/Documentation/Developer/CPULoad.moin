= How To Debug CPU Load Bugs =

In some situations PulseAudio ends up spinning in a loop eating 100% CPU time. This will then be detected by PA's internal CPU load limiter which will then cause a daemon shutdown with the messages "Soft CPU time limit exhausted, terminating" and "Hard CPU time limit exhausted, terminating forcibly."

There might be multiple reasons for this: actual bugs in PulseAudio, or bugs in the ALSA drivers.

It might be worth trying to disable timer scheduling (i.e. "glitch-free") by passing tsched=0 to module-hal-detect. When g-f is enabled PA will dynamically shorten wakeup times when an underrun is hit, to lower the chance that it happens again. Shorter wakeup times mean higher CPU load. Often enough the underruns are caused by broken timing of sound drivers. See BrokenSoundDrivers for more information on that.
