= How To Debug CPU Load Bugs =

In some situations PulseAudio ends up spinning in a loop eating 100% CPU time. This will then be detected by PA's internal CPU load limiter which will then cause a daemon shutdown with the messages "Soft CPU time limit exhausted, terminating" and "Hard CPU time limit exhausted, terminating forcibly."

There might be multiple reasons for this: actual bugs in PulseAudio, or bugs in the ALSA drivers.
