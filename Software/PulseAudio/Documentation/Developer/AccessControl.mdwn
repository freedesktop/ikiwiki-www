# Access Control

## Introduction
Since MIT's introduction of time-sharing in the 60s,¹ operating system's security was classically designed around the user: how to protect a user's applications, time quota, storage quota, and his or her own data, from many other users actively using the very same system.

This user-centric model of security was later inherited into the Personal Computing era, with slight differences. Applications written over the Wintel platform expected full access to the user's data, network, and even other applications files and data. By late 2008, the iPhone shifted the client applications landscape by forcing each application to run _only_ in its own isolated sandbox. By 2012, Docker similarly changed the server side of the equation by mainstreaming application-centric containers and deployment.

The concept of user-centric security is so prevalent that Android, built way before the introduction of Linux Kernel namespaces,² had to achieve basic file-system separation between apps by giving each package a distinct Linux _user_ ID at install time.³

Similar to the massively-succesful mobile model, and like the current efforts of macOS,⁴ the Linux desktop is migrating to a sandboxed model of security.⁵ PulseAudio, a core infrastructure layer of the Linux desktop, should be ready.

## The problem
PulseAudio, being written in the Wintel era of computing,⁶ _heavily follows_ the user-centric model of security. It has usually evaded the security question, almost in entirety, by confining itself to run under user context. 

In the current model, applications can do whatever they like to the state of user's sound. Examples include:

##### Snooping other application's audio
An application can access the final mixed audio of all other applications, sent to any sink, through the use of monitors:

```
$ parec --file-format=wav -d $(pactl list sinks | grep Name | cut -d: -f2 | head).monitor snooped-audio.wav
```

##### Unmediated access to the micophone
Any application can access and access from the microphone. This means that a single browser or internet-facing-application exploit can lead to full audio data access. The simple recording command below can run from the context of any application:

```
$ parec --file-format=wav -d $(pactl list sources | grep Name | grep -v '\.monitor' | cut -d: -f2 | head) microphone-audio.wav
```

##### Control system objects outside of the application domain
Any application can induce system-wide effects regarding user audio. For example, an application can _suspend_ the main sink and the user won't hear audio from _any_ application:

```
$ pactl suspend-sink $(pactl list sinks | grep Name | cut -d: -f2 | head) 1
```

##### Load and unload server modules
Any application can load or unload server modules, with parameters that might event influence the server's network access.

```
