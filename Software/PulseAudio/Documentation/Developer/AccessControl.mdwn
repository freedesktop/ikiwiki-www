# Access Control

## Introduction
Since MIT's introduction of time-sharing in the 60s,¹ operating system's security was classically designed around the user: how to protect a user's applications, time quota, storage quota, and his or her own data, from many other users actively using the very same system.

This user-centric model of security was later inherited into the Personal Computing era, with slight differences. Applications written over the Wintel platform expected full access to the user's data, network, and even other applications files and data. By late 2008, the iPhone shifted the client applications landscape by forcing each application to run _only_ in its own isolated sandbox. By 2012, Docker similarly changed the server side of the equation by mainstreaming application-centric containers and deployment.

The concept of user-centric security is so prevalent that Android, built way before the introduction of Linux Kernel namespaces,² had to achieve basic file-system separation between apps by giving each package a distinct Linux _user_ ID at install time.³

Like iOS and Android, and similar to macOS,⁴ The Linux desktop is migrating to the sandboxed model. PulseAudio, as a core desktop infrastructure layer, should be ready.
