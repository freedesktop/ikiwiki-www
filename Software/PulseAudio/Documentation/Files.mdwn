# Files used by PulseAudio

This page describes what files PulseAudio uses. That includes files that are installed, generated or read by PulseAudio. This information is subject to change at any time, and is only meant to serve as an aid to understanding how PulseAudio works, so if you're a software developer, please don't treat this information as a stable API.

Currently the list of files is very incomplete, because the initial motivation for this page was just to document where the pid file is located. Further information is expected to be added in the future.

It's possible that this page gets out of date - if you notice information that you suspect is wrong, please notify the PulseAudio developers (you can do that via the mailing list or the IRC channel, or just send a mail to tanuk@iki.fi).
