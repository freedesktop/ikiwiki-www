## Notes for Packagers

There's a new optional dependency on libsoxr. The minimum supported version is 0.1.1. libsoxr is used for the soxr-mq, soxr-hq and soxr-vhq resamplers.

## Changes in More Detail

### New libsoxr based resamplers

There are three new libsoxr based resamplers available: soxr-mq, soxr-hq and soxr-vhq. Quality-wise all should be perfect (no audible distortions), but the hq and vhq variants can be used if "even more perfect" quality is desired. The mq and hq variants also have better performance than speex-float-1 (the current default resampler). We would make soxr-mq the default resampler, if it wasn't for one significant drawback: the resamplers can introduce up to 20 ms extra latency.

More discussion about the merits and shortcomings of the new resamplers can be found in this mailing list thread: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.pulseaudio.general/22158
