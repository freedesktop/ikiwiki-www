# PulseAudio 7.0 Release Notes (draft)

## Changes at a Glance

 * New libsoxr based resamplers

## Notes for Application Developers

(nothing important happened)

## Notes for Packagers

There's a new optional dependency on libsoxr. The minimum supported version is 0.1.1. libsoxr is used for the soxr-mq, soxr-hq and soxr-vhq resamplers.

## Changes in More Detail

### New libsoxr based resamplers

There are three new libsoxr based resamplers available: soxr-mq, soxr-hq and soxr-vhq. Quality-wise all should be perfect (no audible distortions), but the hq and vhq variants can be used if "even more perfect" quality is desired. The libsoxr developers [[recommend|http://sox.sourceforge.net/Docs/FAQ]] the hq variant for bit depths up to 16 bits, and the vhq variant for higher bit depths. We don't know what evidence the libsoxr developers base their recommendation on. The statement that even the mq variant is "perfect" is based on Alexander E. Patrakov's measurements using a psychoacoustic model for determining whether any produced distortions are actually audible (they're not). The model is described in this paper: [[http://www.mp3-tech.org/programmer/docs/6_Heusdens.pdf]]

The mq and hq variants have better performance than speex-float-1 (the current default resampler). We would make soxr-mq the default resampler, if it wasn't for one significant drawback: the resamplers can introduce up to 20 ms extra latency.

More discussion about the merits and shortcomings of the new resamplers can be found in this mailing list thread: [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.pulseaudio.general/22158]]
