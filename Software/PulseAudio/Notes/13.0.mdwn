## Notes for end users

### Added support for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio

It's now possible to play Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio encoded audio in passthrough mode. TODO: Are there any caveats? There were some complications related to these formats...

### Improved initial card profile selection

When a new card shows up (during PulseAudio startup or hotplugged), PulseAudio needs to pick the initial profile for the card. Unavailable profiles shouldn't be picked, but module-alsa-card sometimes marked unavailable profiles as available, causing bad initial profile choices. Specifically, if a profile contains a sink and a source, and only one of them is available, the profile should be marked as unavailable, but previously it was marked as available. As a result PulseAudio might pick a profile with a non-working output. That's now fixed.

### Added support for SteelSeries Arctis 5 USB headset

The Arctis headsets are unusual in that they provide separate outputs with separate volume controls for speech and other audio (which is useful with gaming), which requires some custom configuration in PulseAudio. PulseAudio 12.0 added support for the Arctis 7 headset, and now PulseAudio 13.0 adds support for the Arctis 5 headset too.

### New "max_latency_msec" module argument for module-loopback

The "max_latency_msec" module argument can be used to set an upper limit for the loopback latency. By default the latency will automatically increase if there are underruns, but if keeping the latency below a certain limit is more important than the absence of glitches, then this option is useful.

### Fixed S/PDIF for CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio

The "CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio" sound card (probably a generic chip used in several products) uses unusual device indexes for S/PDIF, which is why the default ALSA USB-Audio configuration doesn't work. PulseAudio now has custom configuration to deal with the card.

### Use source sample spec and channel map by default in module-loopback

Previously module-loopback used the sink sample spec and channel map by default, which caused unnecessary resampling, because the sink side of the loopback will anyway be resampled due to the adaptive resampling, and if the sink parameters are different than the source parameters, also the source side needed resampling. Now that we default to the source parameters, the source side of the loopback doesn't need resampling.

### New "avoid_resampling" module argument for module-udev-detect and module-alsa-card

The global "avoid-resampling" option in daemon.conf can now be overridden for all ALSA cards in module-udev-card and for a specific card in module-alsa-card with the "avoid_resampling" module argument. This isn't very useful for end users currently, though, because configuring the option per-card is rather complicated. The new feature is mainly useful for system integrators who want to set a fixed sample rate for the "main" sound card (because that's the rate they test, and other sample rates are a risk), but want to allow e.g. USB sound cards to use any sample rate. To do that, daemon.conf should have "avoid-resampling=yes" set, and udev needs to be configured to set the PULSE_IGNORE variable for the main sound card so that module-udev-detect doesn't load the card, and then module-alsa-card needs to be explicitly loaded for the main sound card in default.pa with "avoid_resampling=no".

## Notes for application developers

### New function to enable realtime scheduling for client threads

pa_thread_make_realtime() is a new utility function that can be used to enable realtime scheduling for the calling thread. That is useful if the application developer doesn't want to figure out the operating system's APIs by themself. The function uses [[RealtimeKit|http://git.0pointer.net/rtkit.git/tree/README]] when available, otherwise operating system specific low-level interfaces are used.

## Notes for packagers

### Removed BlueZ 4 support

BlueZ 5.0 was released in 2012, and the 4.x series has been unmaintained since then. Now PulseAudio has dropped support for BlueZ 4.

### Drop intltool

PulseAudio now uses a newer gettext version that removes the need to use intltool. The required minimum gettext version is now 0.19.8. TODO: Verify the minimum gettext version, apparently the minimum version was picked just based on what Javier Jard√≥n happened to have installed when he wrote the patch.

### Some initial work on a Meson based build system

The plan is to move to a [[Meson|https://mesonbuild.com/]] based build system. There is some initial work done on the Meson migration, but for now the build definitions are not complete enough to be ready for production.
