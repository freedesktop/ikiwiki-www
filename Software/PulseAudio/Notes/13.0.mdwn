# PulseAudio 13.0 release notes (draft)

## Changes at a glance

* New "max_latency_msec" module argument for module-loopback
* Fixed S/PDIF for CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio
* Use source sample spec and channel map by default in module-loopback
* Some initial work on a Meson build system

## Notes for end users

### New "max_latency_msec" module argument for module-loopback

The "max_latency_msec" module argument can be used to set an upper limit for the loopback latency. By default the latency will automatically increase if there are underruns, but if keeping the latency below a certain limit is more important than the absence of glitches, then this option is useful.

### Fixed S/PDIF for CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio

The "CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio" sound card (probably a generic chip used in several products) uses unusual device indexes for S/PDIF, which is why the default ALSA USB-Audio configuration doesn't work. PulseAudio now has custom configuration to deal with the card.

### Use source sample spec and channel map by default in module-loopback

Previously module-loopback used the sink sample spec and channel map by default, which caused unnecessary resampling, because the sink side of the loopback will anyway be resampled due to the adaptive resampling, and if the sink parameters are different than the source parameters, also the source side needed resampling. Now that we default to the source parameters, the source side of the loopback doesn't need resampling.

### Some initial work on a Meson based build system

The plan is to move to a [[Meson|https://mesonbuild.com/]] based build system. There is some initial work done on the Meson migration, but for now the build definitions are not complete enough to be ready for production.
