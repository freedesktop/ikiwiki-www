### Fixed S/PDIF for CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio

The "CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio" sound card (probably a generic chip used in several products) uses unusual device indexes for S/PDIF, which is why the default ALSA USB-Audio configuration doesn't work. PulseAudio now has custom configuration to deal with the card.
