## Changes at a glance

* Fixed S/PDIF for CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio
* Some initial work on a Meson build system

## Notes for end users

### Fixed S/PDIF for CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio

The "CMEDIA USB2.0 High-Speed True HD Audio" sound card (probably a generic chip used in several products) uses unusual device indexes for S/PDIF, which is why the default ALSA USB-Audio configuration doesn't work. PulseAudio now has custom configuration to deal with the card.

### Some initial work on a Meson based build system

The plan is to move to a [[Meson|https://mesonbuild.com/]] based build system. There is some initial work done on the Meson migration, but for now the build definitions are not complete enough to be ready for production.
