### Support for newer AirPlay hardware

Previously the RAOP sink in PulseAudio only supported an older version of the protocol, which is not any more used in newer AirPlay products. Hajime Fujita has been maintaining [[his own version of PulseAudio|https://hfujita.github.io/pulseaudio-raop2/]] (with patches from several other contributors too) that supports also the newer RAOP protocol version. That work has now been merged upstream.
