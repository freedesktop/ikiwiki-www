# PulseAudio 12.0 release notes (draft)

## Changes at a glance

 * Dell Thunderbolt Dock TB16 speaker jack support
 * Fixed digital input support for some USB sound cards

## Notes for end users

### Dell Thunderbolt Dock TB16 speaker jack support

TB16 has a speaker jack that PulseAudio didn't previously make available by default. That has now been fixed.

### Fixed digital input support for some USB sound cards

Some USB sound cards require the "PCM Capture Source" control in the ALSA mixer to be set to "IEC958 In" in order to be able to record from the digital input, but PulseAudio didn't do that. Now it does.
