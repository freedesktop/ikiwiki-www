## Changes at a glance

 * Dropped dependency to json-c

## Notes for end users

### New module for prioritizing passthrough streams (module-allow-passthrough)

Passthrough streams are streams whose content must go completely unaltered from the application to the sound card, and they are mainly used for playing back compressed audio through an S/PDIF connection. When a passthrough stream is playing to a device, no other streams can play at the same time to the same device, and if there's already something playing when a passthrough stream is created, the passthrough stream creation will normally fail. Now we have a new module, called module-allow-passthrough, which will give higher priority to passthrough streams, so that if there are other streams playing when a passthrough stream is created, those other streams will be moved out of the way to a dummy device.

### Dropped dependency to json-c

libpulse previously used json-c internally, which forced applications to link to json-c too. That caused crashing in some GLib applications, because json-c and json-glib both use the same name for some functions. To solve this, we implemented the necessary JSON functionality directly in libpulse, so we don't depend on json-c any more.
