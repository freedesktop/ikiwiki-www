# PulseAudio 10.0 release notes (draft)

## Changes at a glance

 * New module for prioritizing passthrough streams (module-allow-passthrough)
 * Improvements to module-loopback
 * Dropped dependency to json-c
 * When using systemd to start PulseAudio, pulseaudio.socket is started first

## Notes for end users

### New module for prioritizing passthrough streams (module-allow-passthrough)

Passthrough streams are streams whose content must go completely unaltered from the application to the sound card, and they are mainly used for playing back compressed audio through an S/PDIF connection. When a passthrough stream is playing to a device, no other streams can play at the same time to the same device, and if there's already something playing when a passthrough stream is created, the passthrough stream creation will normally fail. Now we have a new module, called module-allow-passthrough, which will give higher priority to passthrough streams, so that if there are other streams playing when a passthrough stream is created, those other streams will be moved out of the way to a dummy device.

### Improvements to module-loopback

TODO: Try to explain what has changed.

### Dropped dependency to json-c

libpulse previously used json-c internally, which forced applications to link to json-c too. That caused crashing in some GLib applications, because json-c and json-glib both use the same name for some functions. To solve this, we implemented the necessary JSON functionality directly in libpulse, so we don't depend on json-c any more.

### When using systemd to start PulseAudio, pulseaudio.socket is started first

The pulseaudio.service unit now depends on pulseaudio.socket, meaning that before systemd starts PulseAudio, it will always first set up the socket. This is done to avoid confusing behaviour in certain corner cases (see the comments in [[pulseaudio.service|https://cgit.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/tree/src/daemon/systemd/user/pulseaudio.service.in?id=edff1b2204587925178ffd00736afdbcdfb8778f]] for a more detailed explanation).
