### New module for prioritizing passthrough streams (module-allow-passthrough)

Passthrough streams are streams whose content must go completely unaltered from the application to the sound card, and they are mainly used for playing back compressed audio through an S/PDIF connection. When a passthrough stream is playing to a device, no other streams can play at the same time to the same device, and if there's already something playing when a passthrough stream is created, the passthrough stream creation will normally fail. Now we have a new module, called module-allow-passthrough, which will give higher priority to passthrough streams, so that if there are other streams playing when a passthrough stream is created, those other streams will be moved out of the way to a dummy device.
