## Notes for end users

### Automatic routing more likely to change profile

In case a sound card contains more than one profile (e g analog and HDMI profiles), module-switch-on-port-available will now switch away from the profile when no ports are available. E g, on a HTPC with headphones and HDMI outputs only, unplugging headphones will reroute the sound to HDMI, which did not work before. In addition, we also remember the last used profile for a port, so the expected HDMI profile is chosen (instead of just falling back to stereo).

Note that many systems have HDMI and analog output on separate sound cards, so this might not improve the situation for all systems.

### OS X support improvements

Some improvements were made to PulseAudio's OS X support. The most notable change is that the default configuration should now work out-of-the-box, thanks to adding module-coreaudio-detect to the default configuration.

### NetBSD support improvements

PulseAudio is available to NetBSD users through the pkgsrc framework. The pkgsrc version of PulseAudio has carried many patches, most of which have now been applied upstream, so the difference between the upstream and pkgsrc versions is now much smaller.

### PULSE_LOG_JOURNAL environment variable

If the PULSE_LOG_JOURNAL environment variable is defined, all client libraries will log their output to the systemd journal. (If both PULSE_LOG_JOURNAL and PULSE_LOG_SYSLOG are defined, logging to the systemd journal takes a higher precedence.)

### New script for measuring memory consumption

A new script was created for measuring the server memory consumption growth when the number of clients increases. The script's location is scripts/benchmark_memory_usage.sh in the source code tree, and it's meant to only be run from the source code tree.

## Notes for application developers

### New LFE balance programming interface

There's a new API for controlling the LFE (a.k.a. subwoofer) channel volume relative to all other (except mono and aux) channels.

Some background: the "native" volume representation in PulseAudio is to have independent volume for each channel, but some UIs may prefer to have one "overall volume" slider and two sliders for controlling the left-right and rear-front balances. There have always been helper functions for mapping the left-right and rear-front balances to per-channel volumes and vice versa. The LFE channel is not included in any of the conversions, however. To allow users to also control the LFE channel volume some UIs (at least the Gnome sound configuration tool) have added the LFE channel control as a separate slider, but in practice that had weird interactions with the overall volume slider.

To resolve this problem, we now have helper functions for controlling the balance between LFE and non-LFE channels, which allow changing the balance without affecting the overall volume. All applications that present the left-right and rear-front balances to the user are advised to start using the new API for dealing with the LFE volume.

The new functions are `pa_cvolume_get_lfe_balance`, `pa_cvolume_set_lfe_balance` and `pa_channel_map_can_lfe_balance`.

### Module-dbus-protocol improvements

Port and card profile availability is now visible through the D-Bus API.

## Notes for packagers

### More flexible configuration file handling

The configuration files /etc/pulse/client.conf and /etc/pulse/daemon.conf can now be amended by creating files under /etc/pulse/client.conf.d and /etc/pulse/deamon.conf.d. This makes it easier for distributions to handle a situation where some configuration option should be set differently if a particular package is installed. Options set in the files installed in the .d directories override the options set in the main files.

### pulsecore-8.0.so moved to a private directory

pulsecore-X.Y.so used to be installed in the top level /usr/lib directory, but that was not a good place for it, since it's an internal library not meant for applications. The library is now installed under /usr/lib/pulseaudio.
