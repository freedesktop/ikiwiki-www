# Writing pulseaudio profiles


## Intended audience

If you have non-standard sound hardware that is not supported well enough by PulseAudio out of the box, and it falls under approximately one of the following categories:

* Your hardware cannot be opened with the front:x string that PulseAudio uses by default, and you haven't fixed this at the alsa-lib layer (see your /usr/share/alsa/cards/ for examples of how that is done)
* Your hardware does not expose normal volume control names such as "Master", "PCM", "Headphone" etc but instead e g "Megaphone" and "Leslie speaker".
* Your hardware has a "Ultra Disturb-Your-Neighbour Boom Bass" switch, which sounds slightly worse than a normal EQ, but you yet feel you have to expose it in the UI.

## How PulseAudio processes config files

You will have to do this in three steps:

* you need an **udev rule** to match your device(s)
* you need a **profile set** file to specify how to open the device and what paths to be used
* you need zero or more **path** files to specify what input/output is controlled by which volume controls (without path files the hardware volume controls won't be used at all, the volume will be implemented in software)

### udev rule

Have a look at `/lib/udev/rules.d/90-pulseaudio.rules`

Either add to that or make your own to call your custom configuration, for example 91-pulseaudio.rules that could look something like this:

    SUBSYSTEM!="sound", GOTO="pulseaudio_end"
    ACTION!="change", GOTO="pulseaudio_end"
    KERNEL!="card*", GOTO="pulseaudio_end"

    SUBSYSTEMS=="pci", RESULT=="?*", ATTRS{vendor}=="0x8086", ATTRS{device}=="0x1c20", ENV{PULSE_PROFILE_SET}="pulseaudio-conexant.conf"

    LABEL="pulseaudio_end"


During the system start, when the card is detected, the PULSE_PROFILE_SET variable will be set in the udev database, and PulseAudio will be forced to use pulseaudio-conexant.conf. We will explain later how to fake that event for debugging.

[[Here's a guide|http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html]] about how to write your own udev rules.


### pulseaudio profile set

The file mentioned in udev rule, (e g "pulseaudio-conexant.conf") must exist in `/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets`

In the beginning of default.conf, you can see comments describing file format, but not in a great details. Here is an example of the statements from the real file:

    [Mapping analog-stereo]
    device-strings = front:%f hw:%f
    channel-map = left,right
    paths-output = analog-output analog-output-speaker analog-output-desktop-speaker analog-output-headphones analog-output-headphones-2 analog-output-mono analog-output-lfe-on-mono
    paths-input = analog-input-front-mic-cx analog-input-rear-mic-cx analog-input-mic-cx analog-input-linein-cx
    priority = 10

`device-strings` describes the ALSA device string(s) that PulseAudio uses to open the device, where "%f" specifies the card number (should always be present in the string).

`paths-output` and `path-input` specify names of different paths with .conf added(See next bullet)


### pulseaudio paths

PulseAudio path files must be located in `/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths`.

You need to specify one file per "Use Case", e g "Headphone output" and "Speaker output" would be two different files.

Here's a quick one to see the inputs and outputs for your HDA card:  `ls /proc/asound/card*/codec* | xargs grep "\[\(Jack\|Fixed\|Both\)"`

Let's take `analog-input-rear-mic-cx.conf` as an example

Some explanation can be found in `analog-output.conf.common`

    [General]
    priority = 89
    name = Rear Microphone

    [Element Rear Mic Boost]
    switch = select
    volume = merge
    override-map.1 = all
    override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

    [Option Rear Mic Boost:on]
    name = input-boost-on

    [Option Rear Mic Boost:off]
    name = input-boost-off

    [Element Rear Mic]
    switch = mute
    volume = merge
    override-map.1 = all
    override-map.2 = all-left,all-right
    required = any

    [Element Capture]
    switch = mute
    volume = merge
    override-map.1 = all
    override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

    [Element Input Source]
    enumeration = select

    [Option Input Source:Rear Mic]
    name = analog-input-microphone-rear

    [Element Capture Source]
    enumeration = select

    [Option Capture Source:Rear Mic]
    name = Rear Microphone

    [Element Mic]
    switch = off
    volume = off

    [Element Internal Mic]
    switch = off
    volume = off

    [Element Front Mic]
    switch = off
    volume = off

    [Element Dock Mic]
    switch = off
    volume = off

    .include analog-input-mic-cx.conf.common

Under  `[General]` `name` is the name that will be seen in pulseaudio Input/Output connector

    [Option Input Source:Rear Mic]
    name = analog-input-microphone-rear

`name` here is a name from alsa-mixer.c from pulseaudio sources (makes localization possible)

It is a good idea to switch off unused `Element` TBD: If not done, does it disabled the whole path?


## Debugging

Info From [[http://pulseaudio.org/ticket/624|http://pulseaudio.org/ticket/624]]

To test the attached profile without going through udev:

You should be able to place that in a file in `/lib/udev/rules.d/90-pulseaudio.rules`  or create a new one `/lib/udev/rules.d/91-pulseaudio.rules`.  And then try it out with

    sudo udevadm trigger -ssound

You will see a speaker indicator blinks and pulseaudio GUI is updated. Now restart pulseaudio by

    pulseaudio -k

also you can check which profile is used by

    udevadm info -qall -p /sys/class/sound/card0/
