At this point in time it is known that the following ALSA sound drivers are broken in regards to "glitch-free" PA:

 - snd-intel8x0
 - all newer Creative cards (snd-emu*)
 - snd-intel-hda on Realtek chips

Possible workarounds to make PA work on these chips are:

- Disabling glitch-free mode. I.e. pass tsched=0 to the alsa modules or module-hal-detect
