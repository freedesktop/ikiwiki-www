PulseAudio contains a lot of non-trivial code that has the side effect of triggering a few bugs in libraries it uses.

 1. libtool's libltdl 1.5.22 is buggy and causes PA to abort immediately after startup with a mutex locking error. Upgrade to 1.5.24 at least.
 1. Some recent libc versions have a locking problem in the dynamic module loader, which will cause PulseAudio to freeze randomly. This has been fixed in Fedora glibc 2.6.90-14. [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=284171 rhbz]
 1. Some older libc6 versions have problems linking PulseAudio, see #152
 1. libatomic_ops for AMD64 is causes random bugs. Make sure to use a compiler that supports !__sync to avoid these issues.
