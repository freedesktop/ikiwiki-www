# Ports: OSX

This page is work in progress. I'm just writing down the steps I'm taking to make this work. 


## git

If you want to be at PA's bleeding edge, you need to have [[git|http://www.git-scm.com]] installed. There's a resource for [[git for Mac OS X|http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3]] which even has a nice installer. 


## Mac Ports

PA depends on quite some libraries which need to be installed in order to make it build from the sources. Fortunately, [[Mac Ports|http://www.macports.org/]] provides all of them. Download and install it, following the instructions found on their side. 

Once set up, you need at least to install the following packages: 


[[!format txt """
sudo port install autoconf automake intltool libtool libsndfile speex-devel gdbm liboil json-c
"""]]
Make sure you add the path to  the binaries built by Mac Ports to your $PATH variable. This is usually /opt/local/bin. And since there are some binaries provided by Mac Ports that also ship with Mac OS X in older versions, make sure the Mac Ports path comes first in the list. Otherwise the build will break. 


## Building

There are some variables that need to be set to make the build process look at the right places of your system. 


[[!format txt """
export CC="gcc-4.2"
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib"
"""]]
Then run 


[[!format txt """
./autogen.sh                            \
        --disable-jack                  \
        --disable-hal                   \
        --disable-bluez                 \
        --disable-dbus                  \
        --disable-avahi
make
