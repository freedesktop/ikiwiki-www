# PulseAudio miniconference 2014 Düsseldorf

The miniconference will be co-located with LinuxCon Europe and a bunch of other conferences. Registration for any of the main conferences (including GstConf) should get you access to the PulseAudio miniconference.

* Time: Wednesday 15th October, starts at 14:00, ends when we're done (we have the reservation for the rest of the day)
* Place: Congress Center Düsseldorf, Room 10

## Attendees

If you want your name in the list below (or remove it from the list), and you don't have write access to the wiki, please send a mail to tanu.kaskinen@linux.intel.com or to the PulseAudio mailing list.

Registering for the miniconference isn't mandatory, but we will have seats only for 10-20 people (the exact number will be clarified if necessary, the probable seating plan has seats for 18 people). If it turns out that this event is hugely popular, and we don't have enough seats, the ones who registered (i.e. are listed here) will get preference.
