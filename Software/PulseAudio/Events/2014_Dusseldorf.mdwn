# PulseAudio miniconference 2014 Düsseldorf

The miniconference will be co-located with [LinuxCon Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe) and a bunch of other conferences ([CloudOpen Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudopen-europe), [Embedded Linux Conference Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference-europe), [KVM Forum](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum), [Linux Plumbers Conference](http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2014/), [GStreamer Conference](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/conference/2014/index.html)). A badge for any of the main conferences should get you access to the PulseAudio miniconference.

* Time: Wednesday 15th October, starts at 14:00, ends when we're done (we have the reservation for the rest of the day)
* Place: Congress Center Düsseldorf, Room 10

## Attendees

If you want your name in the list below (or remove it from the list), and you don't have write access to the wiki, please send a mail to tanu.kaskinen@linux.intel.com or to the PulseAudio mailing list.

Registering for the miniconference isn't mandatory, but we will have seats only for 10-20 people (the exact number will be clarified if necessary, the probable seating plan has seats for 18 people). If it turns out that this event is hugely popular, and we don't have enough seats, the ones who registered (i.e. are listed here) will get preference.

## Topic suggestions

If you want to suggest topics, please send the suggestions to the PulseAudio mailing list.

* Resampler quality evaluation
  * Proposed by: Alexander
  * Which resampler implementations should be kept and which removed as clearly inferior in all aspects? Should the default be changed? If one default resampler doesn't suit everyone - what are the relevant use cases and their acceptance criteria in terms of quality, battery life or whatever else?
