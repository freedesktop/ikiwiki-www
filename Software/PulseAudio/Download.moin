== Distribution ==

Typically !PulseAudio would be provided by your OS distribution. As !PulseAudio forms part of what is typically preferred to as the ''plumbing layer'' of Linux userspace, it is a non-trivial job to integrate it fully to form a complete system. This is why we '''strongly''' encourage you to go via your distribution whenever possible.

== Source Code ==

Download [[http://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/releases/pulseaudio-1.1.tar.xz|PulseAudio 1.1]] now!

(Be sure to check [Software/PulseAudio/Requirements known incompatibilities] before compiling, though.)


== Development Sources ==

Current development sources of !PulseAudio are managed with [[http://git-scm.com/|GIT]] hosted here on [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/|freedesktop.org]].
Browse the repository [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/|online]] or check out the code with:

{{{
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio
}}}

Alternatively if you have trouble connecting (due to firewalls and such), try with the slower HTTP protocol: {{{git clone http://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/pulseaudio/pulseaudio.git}}}

[[http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/GitBranches|Read this explanation about the Git Branches and the release cycle]].
