= Flash Player 9: Experimental PulseAudio support =

'''Update:''' Please note that there's now a newer implementation of libflashsupport.so available from the PulseAudio developers: [http://git.0pointer.de/?p=libflashsupport.git;a=summary gitweb], {{{git-clone http://git.0pointer.de/repos/libflashsupport.git/}}}. Please make sure to use this version for better results. 

''This page describes how to solve the Flash Player 9 problem by building and installing an experimental plugin, libflashsupport.so, which adds support for ESD and PulseAudio.''

This guide is aimed at non-technical users of '''Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon''' or other '''Debian'''-based distributions.

== Installation ==
Make sure you have the following packages installed, additional to PulseAudio
 * build-essential
 * automake1.9
 * autoconf
 * libtool
 * libesd0-dev
 * libpulse-dev
 * libssl-dev

Start a terminal and run this command:
{{{
sudo aptitude install build-essential automake1.9 autoconf libtool libesd0-dev libpulse-dev libssl-dev
}}}
(You can start the terminal by pressing Alt+F2 and typing {{{gnome-terminal}}} or {{{x-terminal-emulator}}})


=== Download source ===
To compile the plugin, you need to get the latest version using
{{{git clone http://git.0pointer.de/repos/libflashsupport.git/}}}

=== Compiling and installing ===
In a terminal, go into the directory you moved the downloaded files into and:
{{{
cd libflashsupport
}}}

Now compile the plugin:
{{{
./bootstrap.sh
make
sudo make install
}}}

(Note that it cannot be installed in /usr/local as flash won't find it there)

Hopefully it should all go well. Restart Firefox and check if it works.

If something goes wrong (like Firefox crashes), this is how to uninstall it again:

=== Uninstalling ===
Close all instances of Firefox (or anything that uses Flash).

Open a terminal and run this command:
{{{
sudo rm /usr/lib/libflashsupport.*
}}}
The plugin is now removed.
