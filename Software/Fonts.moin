=== Font Unicode basic coverage ===

This is a list of Unicode blocks and the ''most'' appropriate font suggested. This list follows a recent discussion at Guadec on figuring out the most appropriate FLOSS fonts a distribution could choose. Font choosing is a subjective and largely debatable task. Please add contructively.

=== Generic fonts.conf configuration file ===

A Linux distribution can finetune the precise font that will be used to render a specific language/script using the configuration files found in /etc/fonts/

We made a list of such existing configuration files, at [[Software_2fFonts_2ffonts_2econf]]. If your distribution is not listed, please add the corresponding configuration file.
