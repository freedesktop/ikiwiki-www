# The Light Display Manager (LightDM)


## Description

LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager.
A display manager is a daemon that:

* Runs display servers (e.g. X) where necessary.
* Runs greeters to allow users to pick which user account and session type to use.
* Allows greeters to perform authentication using PAM.
* Runs session processes once authentication is complete.
* Allows remote login options

Key features of LightDM are: 

* Cross-desktop - supports different desktops
* Supports different display technologies (X, Mir, ...)
* Lightweight - low memory usage and fast performance
* Supports remote login (XDMCP, VNC)
* Comprehensive test suite
* Low code complexity
