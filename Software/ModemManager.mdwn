# What is ModemManager?

ModemManager is a DBus-activated daemon which controls mobile broadband (2G/3G/4G) devices and connections. Whether built-in devices, USB dongles, bluetooth-paired telephones, or professional RS232/USB devices with external power supplies, ModemManager is able to prepare and configure the modems and setup connections with them. *1.0.x* is the stable series of ModemManager using the improved `/org/freedesktop/ModemManager1` interface.
