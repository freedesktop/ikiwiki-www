=== D-Bus users ===

Below is a list of projects using D-Bus. It is not complete so if you know of a project which should be added please just edit the wiki. (Or send mail to the [http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/ mailing list] and see if someone has time to do it for you.)

The list also includes the bus names owned by the projects' software. This is to help avoid namespace clashes as it is important that no two projects use the same bus name. Not all D-Bus usages require owning a bus name, of course.

Be sure to namespace your bus name in com.example.ReverseDomainStyle as well as listing it here.

Finally, the API column shows a code indicating which of the various D-Bus APIs has been used. These are defined as follows:
	''' '''D* - the raw D-BUS library
	''' '''G* - the GLib bindings
	''' '''Q* - the Qt bindings
	''' '''P* - the Python bindings
	''' '''M* - the Mono/.NET bindings
