=== D-BUS users ===

Below, is a list of projects using D-BUS. It is probably not complete so if you know of a project which should be added feel free to do so or send a mail to the [http://freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/ mailing list] and someone can do it for you.

The list also includes the names of the services provided by the projects. This is to help avoid namespace clashes as it is important that no two projects use the same service name. Those with no service name can be generally clients which use a service provided by a different project.

Finally, the API column shows a code indicating which of the various D-BUS APIs has been used. These are defined as follows:
	''' '''D* - the raw D-BUS library
	''' '''G* - the GLib bindings
	''' '''Q* - the Qt bindings
	''' '''P* - the Python bindings
	''' '''M* - the Mono/.NET bindings
