# KMS/DRM based System Console

Overview 

* **`kmscon`** is a system console for linux. It does not depend on any graphics-server on your system (like _X.org_), but instead provides a raw console layer that can be used independently. It can replace the linux kernel console entirely but was designed to work well side-by-side, too. Even though initially targeted at providing internationalization to the system-console, it has grown into a fully modularized console layer including features like multi-head support, internationalized font rendering, XKB-compatible keyboard handling, hardware-accelerated graphics access and more. 
Why the name? 

* `kmscon` uses the **Direct-Rendering-Manager** (DRM) of the linux kernel to access graphics devices. The API that performs mode-setting on displays/monitors is called **Kernel-Mode-Setting** (KMS). Hence its name `kmscon`. Today, `kmscon` can also make use of other graphics-APIs. But these were mainly introduced for backwards-compatibility. KMS/DRM is the way to go!
