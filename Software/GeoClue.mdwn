# GeoClue: The Geolocation Service

Geoclue is a [[D-Bus|http://dbus.freedesktop.org]] service that provides location information. The primary goal of the Geoclue project is to make creating location-aware applications as simple as possible, while the secondary goal is to ensure that no application can access location information without explicit permission from user. 

Geoclue is Free Software, licensed under [[GNU LGPL|http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html]]. It is developed for Linux.

The aim of project is to utilize all possible sources of geolocation to best find user's location:

* WiFi-based geolocation (Accuracy in meters)
* GPS(A) receivers (Extremely accurate)
* 3G modems (Accuracy in kilometers, unless modem has GPS)
* GeoIP: City-level accuracy

Geoclue can currently only do GeoIP and hence accuracy of geolocation is city-level at best. However, there are plans to add support for other sources mentioned above.

Geoclue used to also do (reverse-)geocoding but that functionality has been dropped in favor of [[geocode-glib|http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/geocode-glib/]] library.

## History

Geoclue got started during GNOME Summit 2006 in Boston. At least Keith Preston and Tuomas Kuosmanen can be blamed. 

There was a total rewrite after version 0.9. Use tag "0.9" (as in `git checkout 0.9`) if you need the old code. A copy of the Geoclue wiki page from that time is preserved [[here|http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue?action=recall&rev=32]]. 

## Application ideas

* F-Spot / GThumb: tag photos with location data 
* Stars / [[MaemoStars|MaemoStars]]: show night sky simulation in correct place 
* Map applications ([[MaemoMapper|MaemoMapper]]) show correct location on application open 
* Jabber / Telepathy: support [[XEP-0080|http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0080.html]], add location info to Presence 
* Blog software: add geotags to posts 
* Yahoo Fire Eagle could use Geoclue as data provider 
* Use position/address for desktop settings (timezone, printers, SMTP servers, whatever). [[Marco Polo|http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/]] looks like a good implementation on OS X 
* disable-screensaver-lock-when-at-home 
* Find closest free wifi access point 
* Tracking application (save location history). Could be used later for tagging photos etc. 
* browser, calendar: autofill address form fields (not sure if current location is wanted that often, though?) 
* Browser could expose location to websites: Webkit may support [[Locationaware|http://locationaware.org/]] in the future. 
* [[Google Gears|http://code.google.com/p/google-gears/wiki/LocationAPI]] 

## Possible data sources

* Geocoding for phone numbers - use countries telephone number dial plans to convert phone numbers to general locations (obviously less accuracy with mobiles and world-wide roaming/etc) 
* [[Google Maps Geocoding API|http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/#Geocoding_Examples]] -- License says "only for showing places on Google Maps" 
* [[Wigle.net|http://www.wigle.net/]]-- WIFI location database (10 million networks). License requires users to login. 
* [[geocoder.us|http://geocoder.us]] -- geocoder for the USA (TIGER data) 
* gsmloc-provider could easily get the GSM information using AT commands on the [[OpenMoko|OpenMoko]] platform 
* We _really_ should have a free network location database (like gsmloc.org, but for WLAN, GSM, BT, ethernet gateway, .. 
   * A free network location database project has begun at [[http://geomena.org|http://geomena.org]]
