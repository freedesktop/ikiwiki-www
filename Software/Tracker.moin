= Tracker =

Tracker is a new project to create a high performance, memory efficient file indexer in C. It will also harvest metadata and will generate thumbnails on the fly in response to notified changes in files. It can be used as a stand alone search application or be integrated into a file manager or VFS.

Tracker is currently under development and utilises the '''embedded''' MySql database which is a standalone shared library and a heavily cut sown version of the full MySql database.
