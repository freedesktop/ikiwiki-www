== HarfBuzz ==

HarfBuzz is an [http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/ OpenType] Layout engine.  The current code was originally derived from the [http://freetype.org/ FreeType] project, developed seperately in [http://pango.org/ Pango] and [http://www.trolltech.com/ Qt], and finally merged back into a common repository as part of this project.

The code has evolved from its original form, has got various improvements and bugs fixed, and has got a glyph-buffer data structure that can be used as a highlevel interface to the layout engine.
