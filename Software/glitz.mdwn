## glitz

Glitz is an OpenGL image compositing library. Glitz provides Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation for geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and rectangles. 

The semantics of glitz are designed to precisely match the specification of the X Render extension. Glitz does not only implement X Render features like component alpha and image transformations, but also support for additional features like convolution filters and color gradients, which are not currently part of the X Render specification. 

The performance and capabilities of glitz are much dependent on graphics hardware. Glitz does not in any way handle software fall-backs when graphics hardware is insufficient. However, glitz will report if any requested operation cannot be carried out by graphics hardware, hence making a higher level software layer responsible for appropriate actions. 

Glitz can be used as a stand-alone layer above OpenGL but is also designed to act as a backend for [[cairo|http://cairographics.org/]], providing it with OpenGL accelerated output.
