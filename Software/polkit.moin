polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes: It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to granting access to privileged operations for unprivileged applications. See the [[http://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html|polkit(8) manual]] page for more detailed information.
