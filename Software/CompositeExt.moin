== X Composite Extension ==
This extension causes a entire sub-tree of the window hierarchy to be rendered to an off-screen buffer.  Applications can then take the contents of that buffer and do whatever they like.  The off-screen buffer can be automatically merged into the parent window or merged by external programs, called compositing managers.  Compositing managers enable [[http://freedesktop.org/~keithp/screenshots/|lots of fun effects]].
