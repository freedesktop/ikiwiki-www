## desktop-file-utils

desktop-file-utils contains a few command line utilities for working with [[desktop entries|Specifications/desktop-entry-spec]]: 

* desktop-file-validate: validates a desktop file and prints warnings/errors about desktop entry specification violations. 
* desktop-file-install: installs a desktop file to the applications directory, optionally munging it a bit in transit. 
* update-desktop-database: updates the database containing a cache of MIME types handled by desktop files. 
It requires [[GLib|http://download.gnome.org/sources/glib/]] to compile, because the implementation requires Unicode utilities and such. 


### Development

The development occurs in git, in the [[xdg/desktop-file-utils|https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/desktop-file-utils]] repository. Bugs should be reported in [[gitlab|https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/desktop-file-utils/issues]].
