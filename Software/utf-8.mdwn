## Project UTF-8

Project UTF-8’s purpose is to document and promote proper Unicode support (particularly UTF-8 support) in free and Open Source software. 

The latest specification for UTF-8, dated 2003-11, can be found as IETF’s STD 63 or [[RFC 3629|http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3629.html]]. 


#### Discussion

There is a mailing list: [[utf-8@lists.freedesktop.org|mailto:utf-8@lists.freedesktop.org]]. To join the list, send a message to [[utf-8-request@lists.freedesktop.org|mailto:utf-8-request@lists.freedesktop.org]] with only the word ‘subscribe’ in the body. [[List archives|http://freedesktop.org/pipermail/utf-8/]] are available.  

IRC discussions happen in the **[[#unicode|irc://irc.gnome.org/unicode]]** channel on **irc.gnome.org**. [[Here|Software/IrcClients]] is a helpful list of irc clients that support UTF-8.

### Project UTF-8 Pages

                     * [[BadSoftware|Software/BadSoftware]]. Contrary to what Markus Kuhn is doing with his [[UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ|http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html]], we will be trying to maintain a list of software that doesn’t support UTF-8. Since UTF-8 is _the_ character set standard, we consider every piece of software that doesn’t support UTF-8 to be very old-fashioned and out of date. 
                     * [[BMP-Only|Software/BMP-Only]]. A list of software that supports only the [[BMP|Software/BMP]] of Unicode, and thus lacks full Unicode support. 
                     * [[Fonts|Software/Fonts]]. A list of free and non-free fonts supporting various ranges of Unicode. 
                     * [[unicode-translation|Software/unicode-translation]]. A subproject of project UTF-8 with the goal of translating Unicode character names and other data into many languages using the gettext framework.
