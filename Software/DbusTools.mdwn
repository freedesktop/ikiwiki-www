If you find yourself developing or debugging D-Bus services or applications which use them, you might find some of these tools useful. 


## Command-line


### Calling remote APIs

`dbus-send`, distributed with D-Bus, allows you to invoke methods on services from the command line. `gdbus` and `qdbus`, shipped with GLib and Qt respectively, provide (arguably) nicer command-line syntax and output for essentially the same task. 


### Monitoring bus traffic

`dbus-monitor`, distributed with D-Bus, prints out traffic on the bus. You can filter the output by passing [[match rules|http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-bus-routing-match-rules]] as arguments. 

The `gdbus monitor` subcommand lets you monitor a particular remote object. 


## Graphical


### D-Feet

Shows the object hierarchy exposed by running services, allowing you to call the methods you see. [[More information.|https://live.gnome.org/DFeet]] 


### Bustle

Records D-Bus traffic (like dbus-monitor) and shows it as a sequence diagram, with built-in filtering and statistics. [[More information.|https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bustle/bustle]]
