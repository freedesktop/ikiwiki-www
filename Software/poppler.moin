|| Patch || URL || Status || Reason ||
|| Display only some pages || http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/poppler/2005-March/000032.html || Not integrated || Will have to wait until poppler-qt gets printing support ||
|| Read page mode || http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/poppler/2005-March/000033.html || Done || ||
|| Read page transition || http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/poppler/2005-March/000034.html and http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/poppler/2005-March/000106.html || Jeff seems to be working on it || Jeff says "better implemented with getTransition doing the dictionary lookup when is is called instead of having the work done on load and returning the cached result in the page object" ||
