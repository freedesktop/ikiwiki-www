This page lists the language bindings for D-Bus, their status and, if appropriate, links to download them.

== GLib ==

The current packaged GLib bindings are distributed with D-Bus.  They are in the process of being removed from the core.  You can find latest glib bindings in Freedesktop's [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus-dbus-glib;a=summary git repo].  It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib

== Python ==

The current packaged Python bindings are distributed with D-Bus.  They are in the process of being removed from the core.  You can find latest Python bindings in Freedesktop's [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus-dbus-python;a=summary git repo].  It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-python

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-python

== Qt4 ==

The current packaged Qt4 bindings are distributed with D-Bus.  Qt4.2 will distribute the bindings as part of the Qt library.  The latest bindings can be obtained in Qt's nightly snapshots.

== .NET ==

The current packaged .NET bindings are distributed with D-Bus.  They are schedualed to be removed from the core but has yet to find a maintainer.  The have been split and placed in a [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus-dbus-mono;a=summary git repo] for anyone who would like to pick up maintainership. It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

== Java ==

There are two versions of the Java bindings. The Java 2 (1.4) bindings work with any free Java VM and Compiler and support most of the common D-Bus features. The Java 5 (1.5) bindings support all of the DBus features, but only work with 1.5-compatible VMs (Currently only Sun).

Documentation for the 1.5 Java bindings is available as [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/dbus-doc/dbus-java/ HTML], [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/dbus-doc/dbus-java.pdf PDF] and [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/dbus-doc/dbus-java.ps PostScript]. [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/dbus-doc/api/ Javadoc APIs] are also available. 

Documentation for the 1.4 bindings is available as [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/dbus-doc-2/dbus-java/ HTML], [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/dbus-doc-2/dbus-java.pdf PDF] and [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/dbus-doc-2/dbus-java.ps PostScript].

== Perl ==

The Perl bindings currently work on any Perl >= 5.8.x and any D-Bus version from 0.33.0 onwards. 
They can be downloaded from [http://search.cpan.org CPAN] under the [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/ Net-DBus] module:
