'''The current version is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-python/dbus-python-0.82.3.tar.gz dbus-python 0.82.3]''', the "not for Trial-3" release. (2007-09-27)

Fixes:

 * Out-of-tree builds with an absolute $(srcdir) can now build docs and run tests
 * Closing private dbus.Bus no longer raises KeyError (fd.o #12096)
 * async_err_cb(MyException()) now works (fd.o #12403)
 * dbus.service.Object.remove_from_connection no longer claims that multiple exports aren't possible (fd.o #12432)
 * Setting _dbus_error_name as a class attribute of DBusException subclasses works again
Deprecations:

 * dbus.Bus(private=True) (use dbus.bus.BusConnection in new code, dbus.Bus basically just adds the shared-connection behaviour)
Licensing:

 * Code for which Collabora is the only copyright holder is now under the same permissive MIT/X11 license under which dbus core is being relicensed (this allows everything the old license would have allowed, and more)
== Java ==
There are now three versions of Java D-Bus. Since version 2.0 it has been a complete native implementation of the protocol and not a wrapper around the reference implementation. 1.x versions are feature-complete bindings around the reference implementation, but only work with 1.5-compatible VMs (Currently only Sun). There are older 1.4-compatible bindings which are feature incomplete and have not had much optimization work. See below if you want to try these.

Java D-Bus is hosted in freedesktop.org's [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-java.git git repository] and can be accessed:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

'''The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-java/dbus-java-2.4.tar.gz dbus-java-2.4.tar.gz]. (2008-02-05)'''
Version 2.4:

   * Add DBusMemberName to force method names or signal names to something
     other than the Java name (suggested byaViktar Vauchkevich <vctr -at-
     yandex -dot- ru>)
   * Don't respond to Introspect/Ping except on the right interface 
     (pointed out by Serkan Kaba <serkan_kaba -at- yahoo -dot- com>)
   * Automatically unexport objects which go out of scope in the 
     parent program (don't hold a strong reference). This is now
     optional and not the default for 1. sanity and 2. a possible
     bug in the WeakReference workings in Sun.
   * Add fallback objects---a single object can be called for any
     object under a given path prefix.
   * Add support for localization of strings via gettext.
   * Throw a nicer error when signals are not declared as part of an
     interface.
   * .viewerclasses needs to depend on .binclasses
   * Use libunixsocket-java support for writing multiple byte arrays at 
     once to write message vectors
   * check that the unix-socket-received uid matches for connections to 
     DBusDaemon
   * Update to use libunixsocket-java syntax which works on BSDs
   * Fix utf-8 characters used in test to actually be the same character...
   * Add code to preallocate the buffer array array (Suggested by Adam
     Bennett <cruxic -at- gmail -dot- com>)
   * Fix warnings when building with gcj (fixes a bug in Peer handling and
     DBusSerializable handling)


'''The previous release was [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-java/dbus-java-2.3.2.tar.gz dbus-java-2.3.2.tar.gz]. (2007-12-01)'''

 * Fix minor bug in AbstractConnection.java (reported by Frank Benoit

  . <gzsombor -at- gmail -dot- com>)

  . the name exported on the bus.
The last release binding the reference implementation is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-java/libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz].

Documentation and API reference for the Java implementation of D-Bus is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-java/ here].

The older 1.4-compatible bindings are still available [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/java here].

The Maintainer is Matthew Johnson < dbus@matthew.ath.cx >

== Qt4 ==
The D-Bus bindings for Qt4 are distributed alongside Qt itself, starting with version 4.2. The latest release can be found at http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index. More recent versions can be found in Qt's [http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/snapshots nightly snapshots].

== Perl ==
The Perl bindings currently work on any Perl >= 5.8.x and any D-Bus version from 0.33.0 onwards.  They can be downloaded from [http://search.cpan.org CPAN] under the [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/ Net-DBus] module:

 * [http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DA/DANBERR/Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz]
 * [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus.pm API documentation]
 * [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus/Tutorial.pod Tutorials]
The maintainer is [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/ Daniel P. Berrange], and the source code is managed in a Mercurial repository at http://hg.berrange.com/libraries/net-dbus--devel

== C++ ==
[:Software/dbus-cpp:dbus-cpp] was started almost three years ago to provide a C++ API for D-Bus, but is unfortunately abandoned since then. For this reason PaoloDurante wrote a pure C++ binding ([:Software/dbus-c++:dbus-c++]) while working on the [http://dev.openwengo.com/ OpenWengo] softphone.

== Pascal ==
Pascal bindings are in progress and details can be found [http://www.freepascal.org/wiki/index.php/FPC_and_DBus here].

== Qt3 ==
There is a Qt3 backport of the Qt4 bindings available under [http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport/ WebSVN@KDE] and [ http://people.freedesktop.org/~krake/dbus-1-qt3/libdbus-1-qt3-0.8.tar.gz Sources ca. 600 KB]

Check out through anonymous SVN is also avialable: ''svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport''

API documentation can be found here: [http://people.freedesktop.org/~krake/dbus-1-qt3/api-docs/ API Docs]

The maintainer is Kevin Krammer < kevin.krammer@gmx.at >

== .NET ==
The .NET bindings located in the D-Bus GIT server is unmaintained. They are scheduled to be removed unless a maintainer steps up.  The have been split and placed in a [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-mono.git git repo] for anyone who would like to pick up maintainership. It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For those interested in .NET support, the [http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp D-Bus Sharp] implementation provides an alternative and is in active development. D-Bus Sharp is not a binding to the reference implementation, but an alternative implementation of the D-Bus protocol.

== Ruby ==
The most active and complete ruby implementation at this point is the ruby-dbus project at https://trac.luon.net/ruby-dbus/.  This is a follow on from the original ruby-dbus project on rubyforge.

Sven Herzberg was asked by a friend to develop dbus bindings for ruby. His git repository is located at: http://www.blaubeermuffin.de/rdbus.git

== Scheme ==
[http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org Chicken Scheme] binding can be found at chicken's ''Egg Repository'' as [http://chicken.wiki.br/dbus dbus egg]. The same place contains few short usage samples.
