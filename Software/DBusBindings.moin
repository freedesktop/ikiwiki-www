'''The current version is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-python/dbus-python-0.82.3.tar.gz dbus-python 0.82.3]''', the "not for Trial-3" release. (2007-09-27)

Fixes:

 * Out-of-tree builds with an absolute $(srcdir) can now build docs and run tests
 * Closing private dbus.Bus no longer raises KeyError (fd.o #12096)
 * async_err_cb(MyException()) now works (fd.o #12403)
 * dbus.service.Object.remove_from_connection no longer claims that multiple exports aren't possible (fd.o #12432)
 * Setting _dbus_error_name as a class attribute of DBusException subclasses works again
Deprecations:

 * dbus.Bus(private=True) (use dbus.bus.BusConnection in new code, dbus.Bus basically just adds the shared-connection behaviour)
Licensing:

 * Code for which Collabora is the only copyright holder is now under the same permissive MIT/X11 license under which dbus core is being relicensed (this allows everything the old license would have allowed, and more)
== Java ==
There are now three versions of Java D-Bus. Since version 2.0 it has been a complete native implementation of the protocol and not a wrapper around the reference implementation. 1.x versions are feature-complete bindings around the reference implementation, but only work with 1.5-compatible VMs (Currently only Sun). There are older 1.4-compatible bindings which are feature incomplete and have not had much optimization work. See below if you want to try these.

Java D-Bus is hosted in freedesktop.org's [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-java.git git repository] and can be accessed:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

The last release binding the reference implementation is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-java/libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz].

Documentation and API reference for the Java implementation of D-Bus is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-java/ here].

The older 1.4-compatible bindings are still available [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/java here].

The Maintainer is Matthew Johnson < dbus@matthew.ath.cx >

== Qt4 ==
The D-Bus bindings for Qt4 are distributed alongside Qt itself, starting with version 4.2. The latest release can be found at http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index. More recent versions can be found in Qt's [http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/snapshots nightly snapshots].

== Perl ==
The Perl bindings currently work on any Perl >= 5.8.x and any D-Bus version from 0.33.0 onwards.  They can be downloaded from [http://search.cpan.org CPAN] under the [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/ Net-DBus] module:

 * [http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DA/DANBERR/Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz]
 * [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus.pm API documentation]
 * [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus/Tutorial.pod Tutorials]
The maintainer is [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/ Daniel P. Berrange], and the source code is managed in a Mercurial repository at http://hg.berrange.com/libraries/net-dbus--devel

== C++ ==
[:Software/dbus-cpp:dbus-cpp] was started almost three years ago to provide a C++ API for D-Bus, but is unfortunately abandoned since then. For this reason PaoloDurante wrote a pure C++ binding while working on the [http://dev.openwengo.com/ OpenWengo] softphone.

The most recent version is available on freedesktop.org via Git,  just do

{{{
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-c++/}}}
== Pascal ==
Pascal bindings are in progress and details can be found [http://www.freepascal.org/wiki/index.php/FPC_and_DBus here].

== Qt3 ==
There is a Qt3 backport of the Qt4 bindings available under [http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport/ WebSVN@KDE] and [ http://people.freedesktop.org/~krake/dbus-1-qt3/libdbus-1-qt3-0.8.tar.gz Sources ca. 600 KB]

Check out through anonymous SVN is also avialable: ''svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport''

API documentation can be found here: [http://people.freedesktop.org/~krake/dbus-1-qt3/api-docs/ API Docs]

The maintainer is Kevin Krammer < kevin.krammer@gmx.at >

== .NET ==
The .NET bindings located in the D-Bus GIT server is unmaintained. They are scheduled to be removed unless a maintainer steps up.  The have been split and placed in a [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-mono.git git repo] for anyone who would like to pick up maintainership. It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For those interested in .NET support, the [http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp D-Bus Sharp] implementation provides an alternative and is in active development. D-Bus Sharp is not a binding to the reference implementation, but an alternative implementation of the D-Bus protocol.

== Ruby ==
The most active and complete ruby implementation at this point is the ruby-dbus project at https://trac.luon.net/ruby-dbus/.  This is a follow on from the original ruby-dbus project on rubyforge.

Sven Herzberg was asked by a friend to develop dbus bindings for ruby. His git repository is located at: http://www.blaubeermuffin.de/rdbus.git
