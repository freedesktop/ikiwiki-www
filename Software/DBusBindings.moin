This page lists the language bindings for D-Bus, their status and, if appropriate, links to download them.

== GLib ==

The D-Bus GLib bindings have been removed from the core. You can find latest glib bindings in Freedesktop's [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-glib.git git repo].  It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib

'''The latest release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib/dbus-glib-0.72.tar.gz dbus-glib-0.72.tar.gz]. (2006-10-25)'''

I should highlight that now dbus-binding-tool requires the --prefix flag, as it was generating nonsense without it. This might trip some users up.

 * Only use -Wfloat-equal if compiler supports it (Closes #7658. Thanks to Jens Granseuer <jensgr@gmx.net> for the patch).
 * Return NULL from g_return_val_if_fail in dbus_g_proxy_begin_call (Closes #4159.)

   * Correctly installs a few missing headers
   * Build was cleaned up a bit

== Python ==

The D-Bus Python bindings have been removed from the core. You can find latest Python bindings in Freedesktop's [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-python.git git repo].  It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-python

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-python

The current release is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-python/dbus-python-0.80.1.tar.gz dbus-python-0.80.1.tar.gz]. (2006-01-24)
   * The "Everything changes" release (0.80.0), quickly followed by the "oops" release which made it work
   * dbus_bindings and dbus_glib_bindings rewritten in C rather than Pyrex, and renamed to make it clear that they're not intended to be public API
   * Low-level public API moved to dbus.lowlevel to give new users a hint that it's probably not what they want
   * Remove Variant class, add variant_level property on all D-Bus types
   * Make signal matching work as expected after name ownership changes
   * Use unambiguous D-Bus data types when converting from D-Bus to Python, and follow well-defined rules when converting from Python to D-Bus
   * Add utf8_strings and byte_arrays options in various places, so a user can tweak the calling conventions to be more efficient
   * Raise error if no main loop is configured and the user does something that only works with a main loop
   * Make async method calls actually async when made while still introspecting
   * Redo main loop machinery to allow for pure-Python main loops later
   * Allow construction of a dbus.service.Object if you have no BusName
   * Remove dependency on libxml2 by porting introspection XML parser to use expat
   * Port build system from distutils to autofoo
   * Install a header file for third-party main loop integration
   * Python 2.5-compatible, on 32 and 64 bit
   * More documentation, tests, examples, interoperability tests

The previous release (ignoring 0.80.0) was [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-python/dbus-python-0.71.tar.gz dbus-python-0.71.tar.gz]. (2006-07-24)
   * Binary modules are now installed in the correct directory
   * Distutils exports the dbus and dbus-glib cflags

== Java ==

There are now three versions of Java D-Bus. Since version 2.0 it has been a complete native implementation of the protocol and not a wrapper around the reference implementation. 1.x versions are feature-complete bindings around the reference implementation, but only work with 1.5-compatible VMs (Currently only Sun). There are older 1.4-compatible bindings which are feature incomplete and have not had much optimization work. See below if you want to try these.

Java D-Bus is hosted in freedesktop.org's [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-java.git git repository] and can be accessed:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

The last release binding the reference implementation is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-java/libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz].

Documentation and API reference for the Java implementation of D-Bus is [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-java/ here].

The older 1.4-compatible bindings are still available [http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/java here].

The Maintainer is Matthew Johnson <dbus@matthew.ath.cx>

== Qt4 ==

The D-Bus bindings for Qt4 are distributed alongside Qt itself, starting with version 4.2. The latest release can be found at [http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index]. More recent versions can be found in Qt's [http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/snapshots nightly snapshots].

== Perl ==

The Perl bindings currently work on any Perl >= 5.8.x and any D-Bus version from 0.33.0 onwards. 
They can be downloaded from [http://search.cpan.org CPAN] under the [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/ Net-DBus] module:

 * [http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DA/DANBERR/Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz]
 * [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus.pm API documentation]
 * [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus/Tutorial.pod Tutorials]

The maintainer is [http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/ Daniel P. Berrange], and the source code is managed in a Mercurial repository at [http://hg.berrange.com/libraries/net-dbus--devel]

== C++ ==

[wiki:Software/dbus-cpp dbus-cpp] was started almost three years ago to provide a C++ API for D-Bus, but is unfortunately abandoned since then. For this reason PaoloDurante wrote a pure C++ binding while working on the [http://dev.openwengo.com/ OpenWengo] softphone.

You can browse the code via [http://dev.openwengo.org/trac/openwengo/trac.cgi/browser/wengophone-ng/branches/wengophone-dbus-api/libs/dbus trac]
or download the latest subversion snapshot with
 ''svn --username guest --password guest --non-interactive co `http://dev.openwengo.org/svn/openwengo/wengophone-ng/branches/wengophone-dbus-api/libs/dbus/`''

== Pascal ==

Pascal bindings are in progress and details can be found [http://www.freepascal.org/wiki/index.php/FPC_and_DBus here].

== Qt3 ==

There is a Qt3 backport of the Qt4 bindings available under [http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport/ WebSVN@KDE]
and [http://people.freedesktop.org/~krake/dbus-1-qt3/dbus-1-qt3-0.6.tar.gz Sources ca. 400 KB]

Anonymous SVN access works like this:
''svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport''

The maintainer is Kevin Krammer <kevin.krammer@gmx.at>

== .NET ==

The .NET bindings located in the D-Bus GIT server is unmaintained. They are scheduled to be removed unless a maintainer steps up.  The have been split and placed in a [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-mono.git git repo] for anyone who would like to pick up maintainership. It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For those interested in .NET support, the [http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp D-Bus Sharp] implementation provides an alternative and is in active development. D-Bus Sharp is not a binding to the reference implementation, but an alternative implementation of the D-Bus protocol.


== Ruby ==

Sven Herzberg was asked by a friend to develop dbus bindings for ruby. His git repository is located at: http://www.blaubeermuffin.de/rdbus.git
