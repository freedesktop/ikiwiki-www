D-Bus GLib Bindings 0.80

Thanks to Doug Goldstein, Stian Skelstad, Colin Walters, Tambet Ingo,
Frederic Crozat, Dan Williams, and others for their contributions to
this release.

The most important fix in here is Bug 19441, which was causing
(harmless) denials to appear in syslog from NetworkManager and other
processes with the new core dbus security logging.

'''The current version is [[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-python/dbus-python-0.83.0.tar.gz|dbus-python 0.83.0]]''', the "are we nearly there yet?" release. (2008-07-23)

== Java ==
There are now three versions of Java D-Bus. Since version 2.0 it has been a complete native implementation of the protocol and not a wrapper around the reference implementation. 1.x versions are feature-complete bindings around the reference implementation, but only work with 1.5-compatible VMs (Currently only Sun). There are older 1.4-compatible bindings which are feature incomplete and have not had much optimization work. See below if you want to try these.

Java D-Bus is hosted in freedesktop.org's [[http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-java.git|git repository]] and can be accessed:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-java

The last release binding the reference implementation is [[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-java/libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz|libdbus-java-1.13.tar.gz]].

Documentation and API reference for the Java implementation of D-Bus is [[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-java/|here]].

The older 1.4-compatible bindings are still available [[http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/java|here]].

The Maintainer is Matthew Johnson < dbus@matthew.ath.cx >

== Qt4 ==
The D-Bus bindings for Qt4 are distributed alongside Qt itself, starting with version 4.2.

The bindings are documented at http://doc.trolltech.com/qtdbus.html.

The latest release can be found at http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index. More recent versions can be found in Qt's [[http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/snapshots|nightly snapshots]].

== Perl ==
The Perl bindings currently work on any Perl >= 5.8.x and any D-Bus version from 0.33.0 onwards.  They can be downloaded from [[http://search.cpan.org|CPAN]] under the [[http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/|Net-DBus]] module:

 * [[http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DA/DANBERR/Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz|Net-DBus-0.33.3.tar.gz]]
 * [[http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus.pm|API documentation]]
 * [[http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/Net-DBus-0.33.3/lib/Net/DBus/Tutorial.pod|Tutorials]]
The maintainer is [[http://search.cpan.org/~danberr/|Daniel P. Berrange]], and the source code is managed in a Mercurial repository at http://hg.berrange.com/libraries/net-dbus--devel

== C++ ==
[[Software/dbus-cpp|dbus-cpp]] was started almost three years ago to provide a C++ API for D-Bus, but is unfortunately abandoned since then. For this reason PaoloDurante wrote a pure C++ binding ([[Software/dbus-c++|dbus-c++]]) while working on the [[http://dev.openwengo.com/|OpenWengo]] softphone.

== PHP ==
PHP bindings are in progress and details can be found [[http://pecl.php.net/package/DBus|here]].

== Pascal ==
Pascal bindings are in progress and details can be found [[http://www.freepascal.org/wiki/index.php/FPC_and_DBus|here]].

== Qt3 ==
There is a Qt3 backport of the Qt4 bindings available under [[http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport/|WebSVN@KDE]] and [ http://people.freedesktop.org/~krake/dbus-1-qt3/libdbus-1-qt3-0.8.tar.gz Sources ca. 600 KB]

Check out through anonymous SVN is also avialable: ''svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/dbus-qt4-qt3backport''

API documentation can be found here: [[http://people.freedesktop.org/~krake/dbus-1-qt3/api-docs/|API Docs]]

The maintainer is Kevin Krammer < kevin.krammer@gmx.at >

== .NET ==
The .NET bindings located in the D-Bus GIT server is unmaintained. They are scheduled to be removed unless a maintainer steps up.  The have been split and placed in a [[http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=dbus/dbus-mono.git|git repo]] for anyone who would like to pick up maintainership. It can be accessed via git at:

For users with commit access: git+ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For anonymous read only access: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-mono

For those interested in .NET support, the [[http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp|D-Bus Sharp]] implementation provides an alternative and is in active development. D-Bus Sharp is not a binding to the reference implementation, but an alternative implementation of the D-Bus protocol.

== Ruby ==
The most active and complete ruby implementation at this point is the ruby-dbus project at https://trac.luon.net/ruby-dbus/.  This is a follow on from the original ruby-dbus project on rubyforge.

Sven Herzberg was asked by a friend to develop dbus bindings for ruby. His git repository is located at: http://www.blaubeermuffin.de/rdbus.git

== Scheme ==
[[http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org|Chicken Scheme]] binding can be found at chicken's ''Egg Repository'' as [[http://chicken.wiki.br/dbus|dbus egg]]. The same place contains few short usage samples.

== Tcl ==
The Tcl bindings are hosted under the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbus-tcl|dbus-tcl project at SourceForge]]. At least Tcl version 8.5 is required to use the dbus-tcl package.
