Personally I appreciate the way it works at the moment as a feature, which makes it possible to use different IMs in different windows at the same time, but maybe it's not for people who only use one input method.  Is it feasible to add such an option to SCIM?\ -- Main.[[YukikoBando|YukikoBando]] - 17 Oct 2004\ | |
