= DisplayLink LGPL Library - libdlo =
This is the official [[http://www.displaylink.com|DisplayLink]] Library project, libdlo. This library is an open-source implementation of !DisplayLink USB graphics software, and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1.
This library will discover and connect to !DisplayLink USB graphics chips and allow for developers to support !DisplayLink devices on Linux and other platforms. libdlo itself doesn't include any drivers or applications intended for end-users.

libdlo currently supports the !DisplayLink DL-120 and DL-160 ([[http://www.displaylink.com/displaylink_hardware.html|DL-1x0 Family]], "Alex") and the DL-125, DL-165, and DL-195 ([[http://www.displaylink.com/displaylink_hardware.html|DL-1x5 Family]], "Ollie") chips, though very limited testing has been done on the DL-1x5.

= About DisplayLink and DisplayLink USB Graphics Technology =
!DisplayLink is a chip and software company that develops a technology to connect monitors to PCs through a USB 2.0 cable. !DisplayLink USB graphics works by creating a “virtual graphics card” in software on the PC, compressing the data using a proprietary protocol, and sending the compressed data to a !DisplayLink chip on the far end of a USB 2.0 connection. !DisplayLink technology is available in USB to DVI adapters, USB monitors, USB “Universal” docking stations, and USB projectors.

Additional information about !DisplayLink can be found on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayLink|DisplayLink Wikipedia page]] or the official [[http://displaylink.com|DisplayLink website]]. To contact the !DisplayLink Linux team directly, please send an email to ''linux{at}displaylink.com''.

= Linux Driver Project =
To help release libdlo and encourage collaboration on fully functional Linux drivers, !DisplayLink has enlisted the help of the [[http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/|Linux Driver Project]] (LDP). The LDP are a group of Linux kernel developers (over 200 strong) and project managers (over 10) that develop and maintain Linux kernel drivers. They work with device manufacturers like !DisplayLink to specify, develop, submit to the main kernel, and maintain the kernel drivers. For more information, see the [[http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/FrequentlyAskedQuestions|Linux Driver Project Frequently Asked Questions]].
