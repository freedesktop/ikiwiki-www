 * [[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.2.6.tar.gz|D-Bus 1.2.6]]. (2008-12-05)
Joachim Breitner discovered a mistake in the default configuration for the
system bus (system.conf) which made the default policy for both sent and
received messages was effectively *allow*, and not deny as stated. 

This release fixes the send side permission, but does not change the receive.  See
[[http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2008-December/010702.html|the release announcement]] for more information.

 * [[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.0.2.tar.gz|D-Bus 1.0.2]]. stable release. (2006-12-12)

Bugs fixed in this release:
Fix security bug CVE-2006-6107 match rules can be removed by apps that did not create them
pthread fix

 * [[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.1.4.tar.gz|D-Bus 1.1.4]]. development/unstable release. (2008-01-17)
  * This release is intended to be Release Candidate 2 of major release D-Bus 1.2.0.  If nothing is found to be wrong with this release it will become 1.2.0 within a week.  If we need to make major changes we will release an RC3 and start the process over.
  * Fixes inotify support 
 * [[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.1.2.tar.gz|D-Bus 1.1.2]] development/unstable release. (2007-07-27)
  * This release is intended to be a feature complete beta for stable release 1.2.0, please test it. 1.2.0 will follow pretty soon if no major problems are found. We'll do more betas if significant changes are made.
  * This is a development release, so API's may still change if problems are found (though we will try hard not to).
  * The system bus now supports starting services on demand. This uses a setuid helper program because system bus daemon runs as a nobody user, while services it launches may need to run as a different user. '''''Extra eyes auditing the setuid helper are encouraged and would be timely right now, before 1.2.0. '''''A design doc is available in doc/system-activation.txt
  * The TCP address format has been enhanced, such that TCP may be actually usable. The dbus-daemon man page describes the new elements in the address format. 1.1.1 had added an all_interfaces flag to the format, which has been removed in favor of a cleaner approach.
  * Some thread-related bugs have been fixed, these are important fixes if you are using multiple threads with libdbus, and not important otherwise.
