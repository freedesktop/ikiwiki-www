# importd

systemd 219 and newer include the `systemd-importd` service which may be used to import, export and download additional system images, for running them as local containers using tools such as `systemd-nspawn`. The service is used as backend for `machinectl pull-raw` and `machinectl pull-tar` and related commands.

See [[systemd-importd(8).service|http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-importd.service.html]] for more information.
