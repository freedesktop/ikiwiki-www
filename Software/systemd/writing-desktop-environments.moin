''Or: how to hook up your favourite desktop environment with logind''

systemd's logind service obsoletes ConsoleKit which was previously widely used on Linux distributions. This provides a number of new features, but also requires updating of the Desktop Environment running on it. 

This document should be read together with [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/writing-display-managers|Writing Display Managers]] which focuses on the porting work necessary for display managers.

If required it is possible to implement !ConsoleKit and systemd-logind support in the same desktop environment code, detecting at runtime which interface is needed. The [[http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_booted.html|sd_booted()]] call may be used to determine at runtime whether systemd is used.

To a certain level !ConsoleKit and systemd-logind may be used side-by-side, but a number of features are not available if !ConsoleKit is used.

Please have a look at the [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/logind|Bus API of logind]] and the C API as documented in [[http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd-login.html|sd-login(7)]]. (Also see below)
