# resolved

systemd 229 and newer include a fully featured systemd-resolved DNS resolver implementation. This is a tiny daemon that provides DNS and LLMNR based host name resolution. Since it acts as DNSSEC validating stub resolver it is suitable for retrieving DNS certificate and SSH fingerprint resource records.

See [[systemd-resolved(8).service|http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html]] for more information.
