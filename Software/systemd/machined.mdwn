# logind

systemd 205 and newer include systemd-machined. This is a tiny daemon that tracks locallly running Virtual Machines and Containers in various ways.

See [[systemd-machined(8).service|http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-machined.service.html]] for more information.

The daemon provides both a C library interface as well as a D-Bus interface. The library interface may be used to introspect and watch the state of user logins or seat. The bus interface provides the same but in addition may also be used to make changes to system state. For more information please consult the man pages: [[sd-login(7)|http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd-login.html]]
