= X Testing Software =

This page provides infomation on various tools to aid the testing (
and to a degree, debugging ) of X Servers and Clients.

Please add anything I've missed that you find useful.


== General Testing/Debugging Tools ( Not X specific ) ==

=== gdb ===

GNU interactive debugger.

http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html

=== gcov, gprof ===

Code coverage and profiling. Part of the GCC compiler collection.

http://gcc.gnu.org/

=== valgrind ===

Valgrind is a GPL'd system for debugging and profiling x86-Linux ( and
now powerpc ? ) programs. Very useful for trapping memory leaks.

http://valgrind.kde.org/



== X Server Testing ==


=== rendercheck ===

EricAnholt 's program for testing server render acceleration
correctness. In initial development, available from fd.o git
"xapps/rendercheck/"


=== Xtest suite ===

Old MIT based Test Suite for testing conformance of ported servers.

builds for me via xmkmf, . ./build.sh. Have no idea how to run it.

ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/xtest/

( also see http://www.opengroup.org/testing/testsuites/vsw5.htm )

A slightly updated version of the old test suite with build instruction can be found here: http://wiki.x.org/wiki/XorgTesting

=== x11perf ===

Tests performance of most ( non render ext ) X operations.

Available packaged in most distributions.

=== Misc ===

I did some tests measuring blit speeds with kdrive on various ARM based handhelds. The results of which are available here;

http://handhelds.org/~mallum/fullscreen/

== X Client Testing ==


=== Client X servers ( or X clients that are servers ) ===

==== XSDL, Xnest ====

	Both of these provide servers that run on an existing X server. Useful
	for window manager development or 'emulation' of a different sized
	display. Both are available in [[Infrastructure/git/Users|git]]. Xnest is mature and stable
	but lacks support for 'modern' X extensions ( such as render and
	composite ), whilst Xsdl supports these extensions but is a fairly
	immature application.
        
	 * [[http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xorg/xserver.git;a=tree;f=hw/xnest|Xnest]]
         * [[http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xorg/xserver.git;a=tree;f=hw/kdrive/sdl|Xsdl]]
        
	Xnest is also available packaged in most distributions.

==== Xephyr ====

	Xephyr is a kdrive based X Server which targets a window on a host X Server as its framebuffer.

	See [[Software/Xephyr]]


=== Server side resource leaks ===

==== xrestop ====

	Provides realtime 'top' like statistics of each clients resource
	usage in the server.

	[[Software/xrestop]]


=== EWMH/ICCCM compliance ===

==== Window manager tools. ====

	matchbox & metacity window manager source both contain various
	tools to generate 'dummy' windows with particular properties.

	  http://matchbox.handhelds.org ( grab matchbox-tests )

	  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/metacity/

==== xprop ====

	  Command line tool to inspect window properties. Available packaged
	  for most distributions.


==== wininfo ====

	  New nice window inspection tool with GTK GUI and EWMH hint 'aware'.

	  [[Software/wininfo]]


=== Protocol usage / events ===

==== xev ====

	 xev displays the contents on events recieved by its window.

	 Available packaged for most distributions.

==== xmon ====

	 xmon is an 'interactive X protocol monitor'. It acts as a proxy
	 between a server and clients and provides configurable infomation
	 on the traffic passing through it.

	 Available packaged for most distributions.
	 ( apt-get install xmon on Debian )

====  Also see ====

	 Keith Packards 'X Window System Network Performance' paper;
	 http://freedesktop.org/~keithp/talks/usenix2003/html/net.html

	 Kenton Lees 'Debugging X Input Events';
	 http://www.rahul.net/kenton/events.html


=== Automating Usage ===

==== Xnee  ====

	 Xnee is a suite of programs that can record and replay X events.
	 This allows user interaction to be recorded and played back.
         Xnee can be used as a monitor, to 'retype' a file and to distribute events.
         Xnee can record all data in the X11 protocol.

=== Misc ===

==== matchbox-nest  ====

	  'matchbox nest' is a graphical wrapper around xnest. Its intended
	  for embedded developers that want to simulate a target device (
	  with display, buttons ) on a desktop machine.
