=== Introduction ===
Scratchbox 2 is a cross-compilation engine, it can be used to create a highly flexible SDK. 

SB2 is totally distribution neutral. I develop it currently on Debian/sid. It's known to work at least on Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo and Fedora. Both x86 and amd64 architectures are supported. PPC host support is possible, but not planned. Mac OS X is a potential platform as well, if you're interested in hacking on that, please contact lle at rahina dot org.

For target systems you can do anything that Qemu or sbrsh supports.

=== News ===
 * 2008-12-07 1.99.0.28 Probably the last release this year.
 * 2008-09-29 1.99.0.26 Another development snapshot, getting closer to that mythical 2.0!
 * 2008-06-20 1.99.0.25 Development snapshot, this is what the Maemo SDK+ is using at the moment. Not tested by anyone else, but does work quite well for them. Big thanks to Lauri Aarnio for his hard work!
 * 2008-02-12 1.99.0.23 Various bugfixes and traceability improvements.

=== Installation ===

For holistic instructions for a particular target distribution, see the links at the top of this page.

'''NEVER USE SB2 AS ROOT'''

Because SB2 makes potentially highly confusing things with paths, you just
cannot ever be 100% sure that your real system files are not modified in ways that may be impossible
to recover from if you're using it as root.

Read the [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/sbox2/tree/README|README]] for installation instructions.

NOTE! If you have problems compiling SB2, please check that your make is new enough, GNU make 3.81 or newer is recommended.

=== Bugs ===

Bugs can be reported using [[https://bugs.freedesktop.org|bugzilla]].

=== Toolchains ===
For targeting ARM chips you should probably use [[http://codesourcery.com|CodeSourcery]]'s toolchain.

=== TODO ===
Major things missing are:

 * Documentation

=== CPU Transparency Options ===
Currently SB2 supports Qemu and sbrsh. You need to get a post 2007-06-18 CVS version of Qemu with -drop-ld-preload support.
