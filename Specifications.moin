== These are not really standards ==

Note: freedesktop.org is not a standards body.

==== Draft specifications that have pretty good de facto adoption/agreement: ====
	* [http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xdnd/ DnD] is the drag-and-drop specification shared between ["GTK+"] and ["Qt"]. A [wiki:/XDND local copy] of the spec resides on the wiki. [wiki:/XDNDRevision Work on revisions] are in progress.
	* [wiki:/wm-spec Window manager specification] standardizes extensions to the ICCCM between X desktops; we are also working to merge these extensions into the ICCCM itself as appropriate.
	* The [wiki:/xembed-spec XEmbed] proposed specification for inter-application embedding of controls.
	* [wiki:/clipboards-spec X clipboard explanation] is not a formal specification, but explains our consensus on how the X clipboard works. Qt and GTK+ both follow this document.
	* [http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRING UTF8_STRING] selection format for interchange of UTF-8 data.
	* [http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/ The XML Bookmark Exchange Language], or XBEL, is an Internet "bookmarks" interchange format.
	* [wiki:/desktop-entry-spec Desktop Entry specification] describing information about an application such as the name, icon, and description. These files are used for application launchers and for creating menus of applications that can be launched.
	* [wiki:/menu-spec Menu specification] specifies how menus are built up from desktop entries.
	* [wiki:/basedir-spec Desktop base directory spec] details how desktops should locate files at runtime.
	* The [wiki:/icon-theme-spec Icon Theme specification] proposed specification for a common way to store icon themes.

==== Draft specifications that are new and not yet widely used, though they may be used by one or more desktops or desktop applications: ====
	* The [wiki:/icon-naming-spec Icon Naming specification] proposed specification for a common way to name icons and their contexts in an icon theme.
	* The [wiki:/shared-mime-info-spec shared MIME database] contains common MIME types, descriptions, and rules for determining the types of files.
	* The [wiki:/xsettings-spec XSETTINGS] proposed specification for cross-toolkit configuration of user settings.
	* The [wiki:/direct-save X Direct Save] (XDS) protocol specifies how to save a file by dragging to a file manager window.
	* The [wiki:/systemtray-spec System tray protocol] proposed specification for a "notification area" feature.   [wiki:/SystrayAndAppletsMeeting Notes from the XDevConf meeting].
	* The [wiki:/recent-file-spec Recent File] specification proposed specification for storing lists of recently used files.
	* The [http://triq.net/~jens/thumbnail-spec/index.html Thumbnail] management specification proposed specification for storing file thumbnails ([http://people.freedesktop.org/~vuntz/thumbnail-spec-cache/ copy available here]).
	* Proposal for an [wiki:/clipboards-extension-spec extension to the ICCCM selections mechanism] allowing xclipboard-like tools to limit the amount of transferred data.
	* The [wiki:/startup-notification-spec startup-notification-spec] describes a mechanism to allow desktop environments to track application startup, to provide user feedback and other features.
	* The [wiki:/cursor-spec Cursor Conventions specification] is a draft specification that seeks to standardize usage and names for mouse cursors.
	* The [wiki:/file-uri-spec File URI specification] defines how to interpret file:// URIs, as used for drag and drop and other desktop uses.
	* The [wiki:/clipboard-manager-spec Clipboard manager specification] describes a way for a clipboard manager to store clipboard data when applications quit.
	* The [wiki:/trash-spec Trash specification] provides a common way in which all "Trash can" implementations should store, list, and undelete trashed files.
        * The [wiki:/autostart-spec Autostart specification] describes how applications can be started automatically after the user has logged in and how media can request a specific application to be executed or a specific file on the media to be opened after the media has been mounted. 
        * The [http://ghns.freedesktop.org/spec/ GHNS and DXS specs] describe a collaborative data exchange platform based on the HTTP protocol and web service interaction.

If you feel any of these specs should be moved among the "standard", "de facto", and "proposed" categories, please let us know on xdg-list@lists.freedesktop.org.


==== Proposed X extensions: ====
	* [wiki:Software/FixesExt X Fixes Extension] is a draft specification for changes in how the device independent parts of the X server works.
	* [wiki:Software/XDamage X Damage Extension] is a draft specification for an extension to allow applications to track modified areas within a window or pixmap.
	* [wiki:Software/CompositeExt X Composite Extension] is a draft specification for an extension that moves sub-trees of the window hierarchy to off-screen memory, permitting access to and manipulation of those bits, including constructing the parent window contents programmatically rather than automatically.
	* [wiki:Software/XEvIE X Event Interception Extension] is a draft specification for an extension to allow a client program to intercept all input events. ([http://www.freedesktop.org/~ajax/xevie/xevie.html link])

The above four extensions are deployed as of Xorg 6.8.  Damage and Fixes are enabled by default, while Composite and XEvIE must be enabled by the user at runtime.

==== Specifications currently in the planning/requirements-gathering stages: ====

        * [wiki:/shared-filemetadata-spec Shared File Metadata Spec] (reading/writing/searching file based metadata)

==== Retracted Specifications ====
	* The [wiki:/colorscheme-spec Desktop Color Scheme specification] is a draft specification that defines names for colors to be used for rendering user interface elements.  It also provides an algorithm for generating a matching set of colors from a single base color ('''The colorscheme spec has been pulled on request of its authors''').
