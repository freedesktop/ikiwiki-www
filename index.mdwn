# Welcome to freedesktop.org

freedesktop.org is open source / open discussion software projects working on interoperability and shared technology for X Window System desktops. The most famous [[X desktops|Desktops]] are [[GNOME|http://www.gnome.org]] and [[KDE|http://www.kde.org]], but developers working on any Linux/UNIX GUI technology are welcome to participate. 

freedesktop.org is building a base platform for desktop software on Linux and UNIX.  The elements of this platform have become the backend for higher-level application-visible APIs such as Qt, GTK+, XUL, VCL, WINE, GNOME, and KDE.  The base platform is both [[software|Software]] and [[specifications|Specifications]]. 


## Software

freedesktop.org hosts any "on-topic" software projects.  If you have a project that fits into our mission and needs hosting, please make a request using our [[bugzilla|http://bugs.freedesktop.org]]. Mailing lists about freedesktop software are hosted [[here|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo]]. 


## Standards

freedesktop.org is not a formal standards organization, though some see a need for one that covers some of the areas we are working on.  For Linux operating system standards, look at the [[Linux Standard Base|http://www.linuxbase.org]] project.  [[The X.Org Foundation|http://www.x.org]] and the [[IETF|http://www.ietf.org]] are other groups that do formal standards. The [[Free Standards Group|http://www.freestandards.org]] is one group that publishes "de jure" standards for free software; freedesktop.org is loosely affiliated with the FSG. 

Unlike a standards organization, freedesktop.org is a "collaboration zone" where ideas and code are tossed around, and de facto specifications are encouraged.  The primary entry to these discussions is the [[xdg mailing list|http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xdg]]. 


## Getting Involved

You can get involved in a number of ways.  See the [[MissionStatement]] for our principle activities.  See [[GettingInvolved]] for concrete suggestions on how you can contribute. See [[AccountRequests]] for information on how to obtain commit access to a project.  See [[NewProject]] for how to start a new project.
