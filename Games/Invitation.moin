The Debian and Ubuntu games teams have merged completely and the Fedora
team has been working more and more with us to reduce duplicated work. We
have been using the Debian games mailing list until now, but we decided
that a distro/OS-agnostic list would be better.
At the moment, members of Arch, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD, Gentoo, NetBSD,
Slackbuilds (the officially unofficial Slackware package repository) and
SuSE are on this list.

As Games are somewhat special in that they in general need more patches
than other packages and that they often have a dead upstream, we plan to
discuss some ways there to try and collaborate more.

We have started defining requirements and possible layouts for
below-upstream repositories. Test repositories are in the works.
You can then pull from there and get a common, patched version.
Specific patches would be applied either  in your local
repositories via your existing processes or, in cases where such
an infrastructure does not exist, you could maintain packaging
information etc within our repository.


I hope I managed to interest a few of you and hope to see you on
games@lists.freedesktop.org [1], soon. For an introduction, read
Miry's email [2] and mine [3].
