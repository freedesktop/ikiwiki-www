Ed Trager maintains the [[http://www.unifont.org/|Unifont.org]] web site which provides information about Unicode fonts, Unicode-enabled software, internationalization, and Unicode usability issues on free/libre/open source (FLOSS) operating systems.

One of the better-known resources available on [[http://www.unifont.org/|Unifont.org]] is the [[http://www.unifont.org/fontguide/|Unicode Font Guide For Free/Libre Open Source Operating Systems]] which strives to be a comprehensive and frequently-updated guide to Open Source and liberally-licensed Unicode fonts suitable for use on FLOSS operating systems.

Ed has had an interest in human languages and writing systems since his childhood.  His interest in the internationalization and the globalization of FLOSS operating systems began when he started using Linux some years ago.  He has presented at various conferences, including the 27th Internationalization and Unicode Conference in Berlin in April 2005 where he presented a talk entitled [[http://unifont.org/iuc27/|The Penguin and Unicode: The State of Unicode and Internationalization in Linux]].
