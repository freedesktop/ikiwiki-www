I'm a 21-year-old computer programmer working for the government in a top secret location.  Well, OK, it's not top secret, but it _is_ the government. 

My interests in the desktop area lie mostly in system libraries and tools.  I'm currently interested in a better API for file access and management ([[Software/dvfs|Software/dvfs]]), better identity management in both the desktop and system, and single sign-on support through Kerberos. 

I'm big into game design, especially MUDs, MMORPGs, LARPs, and table-top RPGs.  I've contracted to one game development house and worked (briefly) for Angry Pixels, a Linux-oriented game development company, in addition to open source game development and tons of volunteer work elsewhere. 

Professionally, I work mostly on web applications and websites, focusing on security.  I don't particularly enjoy doing this, but it makes the monies.
