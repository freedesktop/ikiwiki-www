With the work on the open source CinePaint project, ICC Examin and some non open ones I gathered experience around the colour management field. My goal is to build a flexible open source [[ColourManagementSystem|http://www.oyranos.org]] for many kinds of applications and the desktop. I am very often at freenode on the #openicc channel and discuss regulary on the [[OpenIcc|OpenIcc]] email list.
