[[Software/HarfBuzz|HarfBuzz]] (حرف‌باز) is ''my'' Persian translation of "[[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/|OpenType]]", transliterated using the Latin script. It sports a second meaning, but that ain't translatable.

Background: Originally there was this font format called !TrueType.  People and companies started calling their type engines all things ending in Type: !FreeType, !CoolType, !ClearType, etc.  And then came !OpenType, which is the successor of !TrueType.  So, for my !OpenType implementation, I decided to stick with the concept but use the Persian translation.  Which is fitting given that Persian is written in the Arabic script, and !OpenType is an extension of !TrueType that adds support for complex script rendering, and !HarfBuzz is an implementation of !OpenType complex text shaping.

Not to be confused with HarzBuff!
