## Navigation

The header on each page allows you to go to the [[FrontPage|FrontPage]] (home), [[RecentChanges|RecentChanges]] (recent modifications), [[TitleIndex|TitleIndex]] (index of all the page titles), [[WordIndex|WordIndex]] (index of all the words in the page titles), [[SiteNavigation|SiteNavigation]] (list of navigation tools), and [[HelpContents|HelpContents]] (main help page). 

On the upper right you find icons for the most often used functions: 

   *  jumps to the parent page, and is only shown if you are on a subpage (see [[HelpOnEditing/SubPages|HelpOnEditing/SubPages]]) 
   *  refreshes the current page 
   *  shows a printable version of the page without the header or footer 
   *  creates a XML version of the page (currently still experimental, creates [[!MoinMoin StyleBook desc="StyleBook"]], a [[!MoinMoin DocBook desc="DocBook"]] variant) 
   * / allows to subscribe to email notifications for the current page, the brighter version means you have already subscribed to a page 
   *  allows you to say something, i.e. edit the page 
   *  shows meta information about the page, especially the full version history 
   *  shows changes between the current version and the previous version of the page 
   *  shows the search page. 
   *  shows the help page 
   *  links to a user's homepage, if the user is logged in and a page with his login name exists 
Clicking on the Page Title link located in the header above will show every page that references this page. A sample use of this back-referencing, inverted-links feature is the categorization of pages, i.e. [[CategoryHomepage|CategoryHomepage]]. On the bottom of each page, you find the "traditional" edit and search links known from the original wiki, and in addition fields for quick-searching titles and the page texts, plus links to call any custom actions you have installed.
