# Theme Package Specification (Draft)



---

 
## Introduction

This specification is designed to provide a desktop neutral way to package multiple themes inside a single 'metatheme', it does not explain where themes should go. 

It should bring artists and users together, allow artists to create a collection of themes building a certain look and users can install that same collection at the touch of a button to get the look the artist designed. 

Themes should be installed as specified by the [[DesktopThemeSpec|DesktopThemeSpec]]. 


## Theme Package Structure

A theme-package is an archive containing several different kinds of themes and a themepackage file describing all the contents. The archive should be a gzip-compressed tarball with a .theme extension. 

Individual themes are located in different folders, see below: 
[[!format txt """
    /
    /ThemePackage.index
    /gtk-2.0/
    /metacity/
    /xfwm4/
    /icons/
    /cursors/
"""]]

### Theme Package Description

The Theme``Package.index file should be formatted as followed: 


#### Theme Name


[[!format txt """
    [ThemePackage Entry]
    Name=Example theme
"""]]
The Name of the theme, it is required for identification-purposes. 
#### Desktop-file version


[[!format txt """
    Version=1.0
"""]]
The Desktop-file syntax version, this field must be present. 


#### Mime-type


[[!format txt """
    Type=X-ThemePackage
"""]]
The mime-type, this field must be present and have the value _X-Theme``Package_. 


#### Maintainer


[[!format txt """
    Maintainer=John Doe <john DOT doe AT freedesktop DOT org>
"""]]
The Theme``Package maintainer, this field should be present and formatted as followed 

_Name < email >_ 

If for some reason this field is not available, Theme-manager implementations may choose to warn a user about this fact. 


#### Theme version


[[!format txt """
    Theme-Version=1.0
"""]]
The Theme``Package version-number (increases with every update), this field should be present and formatted as followed 

_a[.b[.c[.d[.e]]]]_ Where a, b, c, d and e are numbers between 0 and 4294967296 (32 bits unsigned integers). 


#### Theme components


[[!format txt """
    Contains=gtk-2.0;xfwm4;metacity;icons;wallpapers;cursors
"""]]
A list of themes contained within the [[ThemePackage|ThemePackage]], these strings MUST represent the folder-names inside the archive. However, since not every theme-category might be available, some of the items from this list could be missing. (eg, if it does not contain an icon-theme, just leave out the 'icons' entry from this list) 

It is possible to include any theme-category to a theme-package, given it adheres to the following rules: 

* the category should be unique (eg, it can't be called gtk-2.0 and conflict to existing gtk themes) 
* the theme should be installed in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/themes 
   * This means that the theme data-files can be found in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/themes/THEME_NAME/COMPONENT_NAME/ where THEME_NAME equals the Name field from the Theme``Package.desktop file, and the COMPONENT_NAME equals the name of a theme-category. 
Applications which install themes may choose which components to install but it should also provide an option to install all available components. 


#### Component-related information

You may add an individual section for certain package-components, this can be used to add additional information regarding the individual theme-author and license related to the specific themes. 


##### Author(s) / Artist(s) name(s)


[[!format txt """
    [gtk-2.0]
    Authors=Jane Doe <jane AT freedesktop DOT org>; John Doe <john AT freedesktop DOT org>
"""]]

_Name < email >[; Name < email >[; etc...]]_ 


##### Theme Component Name


[[!format txt """
    Name=Component Theme Name
