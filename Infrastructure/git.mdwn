Owen Taylor has created a tool for integrating git and bugzilla updates.   Documentation is [[provided with the tool|http://git.fishsoup.net/cgit/git-bz/tree/git-bz.txt]] and it has been further described in Owen's blog: [[git-bz: Bugzilla subcommand for Git|http://blog.fishsoup.net/2008/11/16/git-bz-bugzilla-subcommand-for-git/]], [[git bz push|http://blog.fishsoup.net/2009/09/05/git-bz-push/]]. 


## Creating your own repository

Please see the [[repository admin page|Infrastructure/git/RepositoryAdmin]]. 


## cia.vc integration

If you want your notifications on IRC, we support integration with CIA.vc.  File a ticket to have your hook scripts updated, and make sure to tell us what the cia.vc project name is. 


## Migration from CVS

Instructions on [[migrating from CVS|Infrastructure/git/Migration]] are available. 


## Wishlist

We are also maintaining a rough wishlist of what we'd like to see [[changed in git|Infrastructure/git/UIFlaws]].
