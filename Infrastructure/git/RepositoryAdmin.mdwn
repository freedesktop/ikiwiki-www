Creating repositories on freedesktop.org can be done in three ways:
* personal repositories can just be created directly on [[our GitLab instance|https://gitlab.freedesktop.org]] without admin intervention, however please try to keep these at least vaguely on topic for fd.o's scope
* if you administer an existing project, you can create a new repository within your GitLab group without admin intervention
* if you would like to host a new project and create a new GitLab group, please see [[our new projects page|NewProjects]]
