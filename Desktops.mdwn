In general there are two flavors of X desktop. The two most well-known "heavyweight" desktop projects are GNOME and KDE; these include both a _desktop environment_ and an _application development framework_. A desktop environment includes a window manager, help browser, file manager, task bar, and so on. A development framework includes any number of libraries to ease application development, perhaps most importantly a GUI toolkit. GNOME and KDE are the desktops with the most support from Linux distribution vendors. 

The second flavor of X desktop includes a desktop environment only; no development framework is included. The line between this flavor of desktop and a plain old window manager is a bit blurry; many people would describe Xfce, and WindowMaker as desktops in this category. 

The following is a very incomplete list of available desktop environments which make use of freedesktop.org standards.

### Light desktop environments

Many of these desktop environments take a 'mix and match' approach, where you assemble your own desktop from a set of components.

* [[awesome|http://awesome.naquadah.org]]: Highly configurable, next generation framework window manager
