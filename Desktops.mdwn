In general there are two flavors of X desktop. The two most famous "heavyweight" desktop projects are GNOME and KDE; these include both a _desktop environment_ and an _application development framework_. A desktop environment includes a window manager, help browser, file manager, task bar, and so on. A development framework includes any number of libraries to ease application development, perhaps most importantly a GUI toolkit. GNOME and KDE are the desktops with the most support from Linux distribution vendors. 

The second flavor of X desktop includes a desktop environment only; no development framework is included. The line between this flavor of desktop and a plain old window manager is a bit blurry; many people would describe Xfce, [[WindowMaker|WindowMaker]], and Enlightenment as desktops in this category. 

Desktops can be mixed-and-matched; for example, you can run Enlightenment together with GNOME or KDE components; you can run applications developed with the GNOME or KDE development framework under any of the X desktops. One purpose of freedesktop.org is to ensure that this mixing-and-matching remains possible, and promote more of it. Read our [[Mission Statement|MissionStatement]] for details. The executive summary is that people or organizations developing applications do not need to worry about which desktop their users will select. _Applications_ which work with any desktop are easy to write. 

One way to think about the mission of freedesktop.org is this: to ensure that the different development frameworks aren't user-visible.
