# Accessibility

Accessibility is important for a lot of users, without it they just can not use their computer.

## Principles

A few important principles are to be kept in mind

* We want to make existing software accessible, and avoid dedicated software
* We need synchronization: accessibility is another way for input and output
* It should be easily available, ready to be enabled.
