# Accessibility

Accessibility is important for a lot of users, without it they just can not use their computer.

<a href="http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1254#sommaire">“15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability”</a>

## Principles

A few important principles are to be kept in mind

* We want to make existing software accessible, and avoid dedicated software
* We need synchronization: accessibility is another way for input and output
* It should be easily available, ready to be enabled.

Accessibility support is needed in [[Accessibility/Input/]]

Accessibility support is needed in [[Accessibility/Output/]]

Accessibility support is needed in applications, through [[Accessibility/AT-SPI2/]]

* GTK2/GTK3: good support, through [[atk|https://git.gnome.org/atk]] ([[documentation|https://developer.gnome.org/atk/]]), and atk-bridge from [[at-spi2-atk|https://git.gnome.org/at-spi2-atk/]]
* Qt4: only preliminary support, through [[qt-at-spi|https://community.kde.org/Accessibility/qt-atspi]]
* Qt5: improving, [[integrated in Qt5|http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/accessible.html]]
* Java: Basics, through [[java-atk-wrapper|https://wiki.gnome.org/Accessibility/JavaAtkWrapper]]
