# Accessibility

Accessibility is important for a lot of users, without it they just can not use their computer.

<a href="http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1254#sommaire">“15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability”</a>

## Principles

A few important principles are to be kept in mind

* We want to make existing software accessible, and avoid dedicated software
* We need synchronization: accessibility is another way for input and output
* It should be easily available, ready to be enabled.

***

Accessibility support is needed in [[Accessibility/Input/]]

***

Accessibility support is needed in [[Accessibility/Output/]]

***

Accessibility support is needed in applications, through [[Accessibility/AT-SPI2/]]

### AT-SPI2

This is over DBus, toolkit widgets provide their content to screen readers such as Orca.

* GTK2/GTK3: good support
* QT4/5: only preliminary support

Getting it started by hand (normally done by the Desktop Environment session manager):

* /usr/lib/at-spi2-core/at-spi-bus-launcher &
* /usr/lib/at-spi2-core/at-spi2-registryd &
* one can make sure it got registered by using

        $ xprop -root | grep SPI
        AT_SPI_BUS(STRING) = "unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-6fNHBTP2lK,guid=9d17aaa3ca64ff4b66f0c5985442999e"

* That was the bus address, one can watch what happens by spying on it:

        $ dbus-monitor --address unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-6fNHBTP2lK,guid=9d17aaa3ca64ff4b66f0c5985442999e

* Some applications need explicit accessibility enabling:

        export GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge
        export OOO_FORCE_DESKTOP=gnome
        export GNOME_ACCESSIBILITY=1
        export QT_ACCESSIBILITY=1


Accerciser to test the availability of the content

## Wayland

Works just the same :D
