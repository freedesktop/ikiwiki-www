== Mailing lists ==
 * [[http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openchrome-users|openchrome-users]] : General usage discussion. If you have questions, problems or suggestions, post here.
 * [[http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openchrome-devel|openchrome-devel]] : Developer oriented discussion. This is _not_ a support list. 
You need to be subscribed to post to the mailing lists.

In case you are a mailing list newbie: please don't post questions whose answers are easily found in previous postings or in the documentation (this wiki, or man openchrome). Don't post uncompressed full logs, compress them first. Don't post HTML mails, don't top-post.

Please note the mailing lists are now hosted by freedesktop.org. The old archives are still available though (and have been imported into freedesktop.org anyway) :
 * [[http://wiki.openchrome.org/pipermail/openchrome-users/|old openchrome-users archives]]
 * [|http://wiki.openchrome.org/pipermail/openchrome-devel/|old openchrome-devel archives]]
