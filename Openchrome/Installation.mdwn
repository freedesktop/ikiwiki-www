## Prebuilt binaries

It is strongly adviced to use the openchrome packages provided by your distribution or alternatively contributed binaries if openchrome is not officially shipped in your distro.

      * RHEL/Centos 6: Available in the base distribution.

## Install from a release tarball

If your distribution is not shipping openchrome or is shipping and old version and you want to upgrade, this is the recommended method. Don't use the GIT sources unless you absolutely need to. 

Get the latest release tarball from [[http://www.openchrome.org/releases/|http://www.openchrome.org/releases/]], decompress it then build and install the driver: 
[[!format txt """
    wget http://www.openchrome.org/releases/xf86-video-openchrome-latest.tar.gz
    tar xvzf xf86-video-openchrome-latest.tar.gz
    cd xf86-video-openchrome-<version number>
    ./configure --prefix=/usr 
    make
    sudo make install
"""]]

## Install from GIT

If you want to use the very latest, not yet released code, this is what you need. Be warned that although the code in trunk should build at any time, the driver you will obtain might be a bit rough on the edges. The code in the branches might not even compile. You've been warned. Happy hacking :-) 

For Debian based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint), go to webpage related to [[build the openchrome driver|https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenChrome]]. 

First make backups of your current /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/openchrome_drv.so and /usr/lib/libchromeXvMC*so* files â€” these will be overwritten during 'make install' below. 


[[!format txt """
    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/openchrome/xf86-video-openchrome
    cd xf86-video-openchrome
    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-debug --enable-xv-debug
    make
"""]]
and finally: 
[[!format txt """
    su -c 'make install'
"""]]
or 
[[!format txt """
    sudo make install
"""]]

## Source installation build dependencies

In order to build openchrome from sources, you will need to install some build dependencies. Here are some distro specific instructions on how to get them easily : 

* Debian/Ubuntu/Mint 
      * type: 
            * [[!format txt """
sudo apt-get build-dep xserver-xorg-video-openchrome
"""]]to get dependency packages:  [[!format txt """
libdrm-dev libx11-dev x11proto-xf86dri-dev libxext-dev libxvmc-dev x11proto-gl-dev mesa-common-dev
"""]]
      * [[Openchrome build instructions|https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenChrome]] 
* Fedora/RHEL and RHEL clones : 
         * [[!format txt """
yum-builddep xorg-x11-drv-openchrome
"""]]

# Other components installation


## DRM

Building the [[DRM|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Manager]] kernel modules On modern kernels (2.6.22 and later) the DRM is up-to-date. Compile these modules yourself only if your kernel is older. When your libdrm is older than 2.3.0, you also need to build the drm library from source, and when your kernel is older than 2.6.22, also the drm.ko and via.ko kernel modules. 

Get the source 
[[!format txt """
    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/drm
    cd drm
"""]]
Install libdrm Do this part only if your libdrm is older than 2.3.0. 
[[!format txt """
    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install
"""]]
Install kernel modules 
[[!format txt """
    cd linux-core
    make LINUXDIR=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build DRM_MODULES=via
    cp *.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/drm/
    depmod -ae
