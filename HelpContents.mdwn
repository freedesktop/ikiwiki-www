_[Please do not add redundant information on these pages (which has to be maintained at two places then), and follow the established structure of help pages. Also note that the master set of help pages is not public, that this very page you read and all other help pages may be overwritten when the wiki software is updated. So if you have major contributions that should not get lost, send an extra notification notice to the [[MoinMoin|MoinMoin]] user mailing list.]_
