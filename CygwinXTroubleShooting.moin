If you have problems with [wiki:CygwinX Cygwin/X] then you can try to find a solution on this page. Much more is
covered in the [http://x.cygwin.com/docs/faq/cygwin-x-faq.html FAQ] but the sections here will be filled 
in the next weeks.

If you have found a solution to a problem, feel free to add it to the appropriate section.

= General =
== Installation ==
=== cygX11-6.dll not found after installation or upgrade ===

Reinstall the `xorg-x11-bin-dlls` package. Make sure not to reinstall any `XFree-*` packages.
Check if `/usr/X11R6/bin/cygX11-6.dll` does exist. Check if `$PATH` contains `/usr/X11R6/bin`. 

== Clipboard ==
== Keyboard ==
If your keyboard layout is not configured correctly (eg you only get the us layout) please
["mailto:ago@freedesktop.org contact me"] and send me your `/tmp/XWin.log` or at least the
lines similar to these:
{{{
(--) winConfigKeyboard - Layout: "00010407" (00010407) 
(--) Using preset keyboard for "German (Germany, IBM)" (10407), type "4"
}}}

I'll add that entry to the list of known keyboard layouts. If you already know which is the 
correct XKB layout code for your layout please tell me. This will make things quite easy for 
me.

== Cygwin/X Startup ==
=== Cygwin/X freezes right after startup ===
!ZoneAlarm (esp version 5) was reported to break Cygwin/X. Check the log file. The last line
will say something about keyboard layouts. remove !ZoneAlarm to get rid of this.

make sure /tmp is mounted in binmode

=== Duplicate invocation error ===
Most likely you have started XWin twice with startxwin.bat or startx or a similar script.
You can't do this. You can only start XWin once. If you want another terminal window 
(which in fact is just a convenient side effect of running startxwin.bat) you should do
this by starting `xterm` from the cygwin shell or from the startmenu entries.

=== Multiple Users, Multiple XWin ===
If you want to start XWin multiple times, you have to assign each of them a unique display number
eg `XWin :0 $OPTIONS` (this is the default) or `XWin :1 $OPTIONS`. 

If you start XWin with different users and get access proplems in `/tmp/.X11-unix` then disable the 
unix sockets connection scheme by starting the xserver with `XWin -nolisten unix $OPTIONS`. The
`$DISPLAY` variable `:0.0` will not work anymore but can be replaced with `localhost:0.0`.

=== The root window is not shown when starting XWin ===
This is a small problem with run.exe. If you start XWin with -nodecoration, -multiwindow or -fullscreen 
the window will come up normally.

== Appearance ==
=== X as default pointer in multiwindow mode ===

To workaround this add the command `run xsetroot -cursor''name left''ptr -fg white -bg black` to 
`startxwin.bat`

== !XTerm ==
=== Resizing !XTerm does not change linewidth in bash ===

Try starting *resize*. See [http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2004-05/msg00171.html mail] for details.

== Networking ==
=== Personal Firewalls ===

[[CygwinX][Cygwin/X]] requires properly working TCP/IP even for local connections. It listens on port 6000 + 
display number (eg. 6002 for display :2.0). If you use the internal clipboard manager or the 
multiwindow feature it creates network connections even if no other client is connected. 

If you are running a personal firewall make sure you set a rule which allows XWin.exe to connect 
to the port and a rule which allows it to accept connections on the port.

If you are still experiencing problems try disabling the Personal Firewall.

==== Zone Alarm ====

There have been reports that programs are experiencing network problems when running [[CygwinX][Cygwin/X]] with Zone Alarm installed. This is because cygwin creates a new socket everytime select is called and the Zone Alarm networking stack will
then kill connections which are already running on that port.

= Remote Usage =
== SSH X11 Forwarding ==
=== Programs report strange errors ===

See [http://x.cygwin.com/docs/faq/cygwin-x-faq.html#q-ssh-no-x11forwarding FAQ Entry]

== XDMCP ==
=== Cygwin/X reports AUDIT: client 1 rejected from IP ''remotehost'' ===

Problem is maybe a wrong DNS (Network name resolution). 
Make sure your windows host has a hostname which is valid from linux too and an IP address which linux can resolve to that hostname.

If you add a line 

`192.168.26.1 myhost` 

to `/etc/hosts` on the XDMCP server containing the IP address and the hostname of your windows host the name resolution should work.

== Unix flavours ==
=== Keys or mouse buttons not working on AIX, SUN Solaris, HPUX ===
Disable !NumLock. Some programs treat !NumLock as a modifier like Control.

A small program which will do this is available [http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2004-04/msg00307.html here]

=== No keyboard input in Java ===
Disable !NumLock. Same problem as above.

=== Mouse buttons not working in Motif applications on SUN Solaris ===

This is a bug in the Motif libraries from SUN. See [http://support.wrq.com/techdocs/1717.html details]. There is a patch available from SUN: :[http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fpatches/108940 Patch 108940].
