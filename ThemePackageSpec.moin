= Theme Package Specification (Draft) =
----
== Introduction ==
This specification is designed to provide a desktop neutral way to package multiple themes inside a single 'metatheme', it does not explain where themes should go.

It should bring artists and users together, allow artists to create a collection of themes building a certain look and users can install that same collection at the touch of a button to get the look the artist designed.

Themes should be installed as specified by the DesktopThemeSpec.

== Theme Package Structure ==
A theme-package is an archive containing several different kinds of themes and a themepackage file describing all the contents.
The archive should be a gzip-compressed tarball with a .theme extension.

Individual themes are located in different folders, see below:
{{{
    /
    /ThemePackage.index
    /gtk-2.0/
    /metacity/
    /xfwm4/
    /icons/
    /cursors/
}}}

=== Theme Package Description ===
The Theme``Package.index file should be formatted as followed:

==== Theme Name ====
{{{
    [ThemePackage Entry]
    Name=Example theme
}}}
The Name of the theme, it is required for identification-purposes.
==== Desktop-file version ====
{{{
    Version=1.0
}}}
The Desktop-file syntax version, this field must be present.

==== Mime-type ====
{{{
    Type=X-ThemePackage
}}}
The mime-type, this field must be present and have the value ''X-Theme``Package''.

==== Maintainer ====
{{{
    Maintainer=John Doe <john DOT doe AT freedesktop DOT org>
}}}
The Theme``Package maintainer, this field should be present and formatted as followed

''Name < email >''

If for some reason this field is not available, Theme-manager implementations may choose to warn a user about this fact.

==== Theme version ====
{{{
    Theme-Version=1.0
}}}
The Theme``Package version-number (increases with every update), this field should be present and formatted as followed

''a[.b[.c[.d[.e]]]]'' Where a, b, c, d and e are numbers between 0 and 4294967296 (32 bits unsigned integers).

==== Theme components ====
{{{
    Contains=gtk-2.0;xfwm4;metacity;icons;wallpapers;cursors
}}}
A list of themes contained within the ThemePackage, these strings MUST represent the folder-names inside the archive. However, since not every theme-category might be available, some of the items from this list could be missing. (eg, if it does not contain an icon-theme, just leave out the 'icons' entry from this list)

It is possible to include any theme-category to a theme-package, given it adheres to the following rules:
 * the category should be unique (eg, it can't be called gtk-2.0 and conflict to existing gtk themes)
 * the theme should be installed in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/themes
  This means that the theme data-files can be found in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/themes/THEME_NAME/COMPONENT_NAME/ where THEME_NAME equals the Name field from the Theme``Package.desktop file, and the COMPONENT_NAME equals the name of a theme-category.

Applications which install themes may choose which components to install but it should also provide an option to install all available components.

==== Component-related information ====
You may add an individual section for certain package-components, this can be used to add additional information regarding the individual theme-author and license related to the specific themes.

===== Author(s) / Artist(s) name(s) =====
