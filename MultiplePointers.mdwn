                     * Abstract: 
Altho Multiple Input devices can be connected and utilized in a computer desktop environment, such devices have historically been limited to operating one at a time. For example, currently, X only supports a single Pointer per screen / Monitor (altho x can be configured to allow multiple input devices to send events to this Pointer) they are limited to effectively "fight" for control of the Pointer. This and related wiki topics will explore the possibility of allowing not only multiple input devices (such as dual mice) but also multiple cursors and pointers on the screen itself.  

                     * Application: 
The ability to connect multiple input devices (such as keyboards and mice) which are in turn allowed the ability to simultaneously interact with various applications on the desktop would greatly enhance the ability to collaborate in real time on various projects and real world applications including educational and business related settings. 

                     * Goals: 
It is the goal of this section to explore the possibility of developing X to the point of realizing the ability to allow multiple Pointers and Cursers which are each respectively tied to multiple keyboards and mice (or other pointer devices) on a single screen/monitor. Milestones/goals: 

                                             * Multiple Pointers controlled by Multiple mice on a single screen / monitor at the same time 
                                             * Multiple Cursers controlled by Multiple keyboards on a single screen / monitor at the same time
