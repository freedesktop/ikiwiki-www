= OpenICC project =

OpenICC has two main goals. The first goal is to work out a common set of settings for color savvy applications to share profiles and settings. The second goal is to bring together those developers in areas like printing, display and desktop applications to work together to make color management end to end work for open source applications.

A draft specification hoped be published in 2005.

= Getting involved =

If you are planning to add color management to your software project or you are hardware manufacturer who wishes to extend his clients base by deeping toes into opensource water, we encourage you to join our mailing list. Subscription page is [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openicc just round the corner]. #openicc is now available on irc.freenode.net

= Who's taking part =

Currently, OpenICC is an informal group of developers exchanging ideas and concepts on integrating ICC color management. Here is a mostly complete list of project developers involved in this discussion:

 *[http://www.argyllcms.com ArgyllCMS], an experimental, open source, ICC compatible color management system.
 *[http://cinepaint.sourceforge.net Cinepaint], a 16-bit photo retouching application, best suited for video.
 *[http://cups.org CUPS] printing software.
 *[http://www.gimp.org The GIMP], popular photo retouching application
 *[http://gutenprint.org Gutenprint], a set of very high quality drivers for printers, with particular emphasis on inkjets.
 *[http://www.imagemagick.net ImageMagick],  image editing collection.
 *[http://www.inkscape.org Inkscape], a vector graphics editor.
 *[http://www.koffice.org/krita Krita], and [http://www.koffice.org/karbon Karbon], the raster and vector image manipulation applications of the KOffice suite.
 *[http://www.littlecms.com LittleCMS], a widely used opensource color management system.
 *[http://www.scribus.net Scribus], an open source page layout application.
 *[http://www.oyranos.org Oyranos], a colour managment system intented for configuration, user interfaces and profile distribution.

= ICC is going opensource =
The ICC itself has began an opensource project:
 *[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sampleicc/]
SampleICC provides an open source platform independent C++ library for reading, writing, manipulating, and applying ICC profiles along with applications that make use of this library.

= legal issues =
In the middle of the 90ties, there were some patent wars concerning colormanagement. Especialy the company EFI suited a lot of companies, which implemented a RGB to CMYK conversion into their applications.
Actually, it is important to watch, which colormanagement-functionalities are described in the ICC-specs, and which are going beyond the ICC specs. Implementing colormanagement according ICC-specs is very save. Implementing more special functions could may be dangerous.
This concerns especialy littleCMS, which is the standard CMM for more or less all opensource applications dealing with colormanagement. (Of course, argyllCMS also contains a CMM...)
Some of such special functions are very helpful to for some usecases. So from the point of view of the user, it makes a lot of sense to implement and use them. This are e.g. enhanced options for CMYK to CMYK conversions. Such functions are useful for the colormanagement of documents for the graphic arts.
It can be implemented as special function for the CMM, or it can be solved by precalculating a devicelink-profile, which is used with a ICC-conform CMM.
If it is e.g. implemented as special function in littleCMS, a legal issue concerning littleCMS would 
may touch all applications, which make use of littleCMS.
If it is implemented in a standalone software, which generates and delivers a devicelink-profile, the legal issue covers only the standalone software. The usage of devicelink-profiles in other softwares is a standard functionality of the ICC-specs.
