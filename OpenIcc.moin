= OpenICC project =

OpenICC has two main goals. The first goal is to work out a common set of settings for color savvy applications to share profiles and settings. The second goal is to bring together those developers in areas like printing, display and desktop applications to work together to make color management end to end work for open source applications.

A draft specification hoped be published in 2005.

= Getting involved =

If you are planning to add color management to your software project or you are hardware manufacturer who wishes to extend his clients base by deeping toes into opensource water, we encourage you to join our mailing list. Subscription page is [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openicc just round the corner]. #openicc is now available on irc.freenode.net

= Who's taking part =

Currently, OpenICC is an informal group of developers exchanging ideas and concepts on integrating ICC color management. Here is a mostly complete list of project developers involved in this discussion:

 *[http://www.argyllcms.com ArgyllCMS], an experimental, open source, ICC compatible color management system.
 *[http://cinepaint.sourceforge.net Cinepaint], a 16-bit photo retouching application, best suited for video.
 *[http://cups.org CUPS] printing software.
 *[http://www.gimp.org The GIMP], popular photo retouching application
 *[http://gutenprint.org Gutenprint], a set of very high quality drivers for printers, with particular emphasis on inkjets.
 *[http://www.imagemagick.net ImageMagick],  image editing collection.
 *[http://www.inkscape.org Inkscape], a vector graphics editor.
 *[http://www.koffice.org/krita Krita], and [http://www.koffice.org/karbon Karbon], the raster and vector image manipulation applications of the KOffice suite.
 *[http://www.littlecms.com LittleCMS], a widely used opensource color management system.
 *[http://www.scribus.net Scribus], an open source page layout application.
 *[http://www.oyranos.org Oyranos], a colour managment system intented for configuration, user interfaces and profile distribution.

= ICC is going opensource =
The ICC itself has began an opensource project:
 *[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sampleicc/]
SampleICC provides an open source platform independent C++ library for reading, writing, manipulating, and applying ICC profiles along with applications that make use of this library.
