= OpenICC project =

OpenICC has two main goals. The first goal is to work out a common set of settings for color savvy applications to share profiles and settings. The second goal is to bring together those developers in areas like printing, display and desktop applications to work together to make color management end to end work for open source applications.

A draft specification hoped be published in 2005.

= Getting involved =

If you are planning to add color management to your software project or you are hardware manufacturer who wishes to extend his clients base by dipping your toes into opensource water, we encourage you to join our mailing list. Subscription page is [http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openicc just round the corner]. #openicc is now available on irc.freenode.net

= Who's taking part =

Currently, OpenICC is an informal group of developers exchanging ideas and concepts on integrating ICC color management. Here is a mostly complete list of project developers involved in this discussion:

 *[http://www.argyllcms.com ArgyllCMS], an experimental, open source, ICC compatible color management system.
 *[http://cinepaint.sourceforge.net Cinepaint], a 16-bit photo retouching application, best suited for video.
 *[http://cups.org CUPS] printing software.
 *[http://www.graphicsmagick.org/ GraphicsMagick], is the swiss army knife of image processing.
 *[http://www.gimp.org The GIMP], popular pixel manipulation application
 *[http://gutenprint.org Gutenprint], a set of very high quality drivers for printers, with particular emphasis on inkjets.
 *[http://www.imagemagick.net ImageMagick],  image editing collection.
 *[http://www.inkscape.org Inkscape], a vector graphics editor.
 *[http://www.koffice.org/krita Krita], and [http://www.koffice.org/karbon Karbon], the raster and vector image manipulation applications of the KOffice suite.
 *[http://www.littlecms.com LittleCMS], a widely used open source color management system.
 *[http://lprof.sourceforge.net LPROF], an open source profiler that uses LCMS.
 *[http://www.scribus.net Scribus], an open source page layout application.
 *[http://www.oyranos.org Oyranos], a colour management system intended for configuration, user interfaces and profile distribution.

= ICC is going open source =
The ICC itself has began an open source project:
 *[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sampleicc/]
SampleICC provides an open source platform independent C++ library for reading, writing, manipulating, and applying ICC profiles along with applications that make use of this library.

= Legal issues =
In the middle of the 90's, there were some patent wars concerning colormanagement. Specifically the company EFI sued a lot of other companies that had implemented a RGB to CMYK conversion in their applications. Actually, it is important to be aware of which colormanagement-functionalities are part of the ICC-specs, and which are going beyond the ICC specs. Implementing colormanagement according ICC-specs is very safe. Implementing extended functions that are not part of the ICC specification could may be dangerous.  This concerns especially littleCMS, which is the standard CMM for more or less all open source applications dealing with colormanagement. (Of course, argyllCMS also contains a CMM...)
Some of this extended functionality can be very helpful for some usecases. So from the point of view of the user, it makes a lot of sense to implement and use them. One example is enhanced options for CMYK to CMYK conversions. Such functions are useful for the colormanagement of documents for the graphic arts.
It can be implemented as special function for the CMM, or it can be solved by precalculating a devicelink-profile, which is used with a ICC-conforming CMM.
If it is, for example, implemented as special function in littleCMS, a legal issue concerning littleCMS could touch all applications, which make use of littleCMS.
If it is implemented in a standalone software, which generates and delivers a devicelink-profile, the legal issue covers only the standalone software. The usage of devicelink-profiles in other software is a standard functionality of the ICC-specs.
