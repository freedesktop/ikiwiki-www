= OpenICC project =

OpenICC has two main goals. The first goal is to work out a common set of settings for color savvy applications to share profiles and settings. The second goal is to bring together those developers in areas like printing, display and desktop applications to work together to make color management end to end work for open source applications.

A draft specification is planned at a later stage.

= Profiles for standard print condition and their licences =
For the creation and exchange of images, vector graphics and documents (e.g. PDF) ist makes sense, when applications can use a standard set of ICC-profiles which are preinstalled in an known directoty like eg. share/color/profile on every computer. Currently, different organisations, projects and vendors are offering such standard profile packages with different licenses. Not all licenses are compatible to integrate these profile packages into LINUX distributions. 
Furthermore in the graphic arts, there are so called "reference printing conditions" which represent color measurement-data (also called characterization-data) representing a printing standard. Such characterization-data are a basis for calculating ICC-profiles representing a printing standard. 
Several packages for standard ICC profiles are containing CMYK-profiles with different names and calculated with different profiling packages but representing the same reference printing condition.
The International Color Consortium ICC hosts a [[http://www.color.org/registry2.xalter|registry]] for worldwide used reference printing conditions.

Future new ICC profiles for OpenICC should use the same [[http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:16756:201007:jgkgmfkbkeglodlhbmnc|reviewed ]] [[http://www.color.org/registry/profileregistration.xalter|license as the ICC]].

An overview about available packages is here OpenIcc/ProfilePackages


= ICC is going open source =
The ICC itself has began an open source project:
 *[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sampleicc/]]
SampleICC provides an open source platform independent C++ library for reading, writing, manipulating, and applying ICC profiles along with applications that make use of this library.

= Legal issues =
In the middle of the 90's, there were some patent wars concerning colormanagement. Specifically the company EFI sued a lot of other companies that had implemented a RGB to CMYK conversion in their applications. Actually, it is important to be aware of which colormanagement-functionalities are part of the ICC-specs, and which are going beyond the ICC specs. Implementing colormanagement according ICC-specs is very safe. Implementing extended functions that are not part of the ICC specification could may be dangerous.  This concerns especially littleCMS, which is the standard CMM for more or less all open source applications dealing with colormanagement. (Of course, argyllCMS also contains a CMM...)
Some of this extended functionality can be very helpful for some usecases. So from the point of view of the user, it makes a lot of sense to implement and use them. One example is enhanced options for CMYK to CMYK conversions. Such functions are useful for the colormanagement of documents for the graphic arts.
It can be implemented as special function for the CMM, or it can be solved by precalculating a devicelink-profile, which is used with a ICC-conforming CMM.
If it is, for example, implemented as special function in littleCMS, a legal issue concerning littleCMS could touch all applications, which make use of littleCMS.
If it is implemented in a standalone software, which generates and delivers a devicelink-profile, the legal issue covers only the standalone software. The usage of devicelink-profiles in other software is a standard functionality of the ICC-specs.

= Proposals =
== White papers for enhancing the ICC-specs ==
Observing real world colormanagement-workflows with ICC-profiles, it is clear that some problems should be solved with better and more clear defined ICC-specs. Actually, some of such enhancements can be done through "white papers". Such a white paper could e.g. describe extended functions of the CMM. One example of such enhancement is the description of Blackpoint Compensation in Adobe Products at *[[http://www.color.org/Adobe1bpc.pdf]]
If developers or colormanagement-consultants think, that the ICC-specs need some enhancements, the OpenICC wiki could be used as collaborative platform to produce such whitepapers.

Every proposal for an ICC Whitepaper should be a Subpage in the OpenICC wiki and should be structured as following:

 *Which real world use cases are addressed
 *which kind of applications are targeted
 *how should it be implemented technically
 *how should it be implemented in the user interface.

=== Actual proposals for ICC whitepapers ===

==== Better handling of ICC Grey Objects ====
IccGreyObjects

==== Device Settings in ICC ====
[[http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Device_Settings|Device_Settings]] at !ColourWiki includes a specification proposal for handling device settings inside a ICC profile. As device settings are closely related to the validity of ICC profiles, such information should be included to make the profile selection process easier across systems. This provides the means to automatically select or reject a ICC depending on the installed driver software and the to be accessed devices and media.

The proposal can be considered complement to the [[http://www.color.org/ICCSpecRevision_25-02-10_dictType.pdf|ICC meta data tag]].

==== HDR Rendering Description ====
The goal of the HdrRenderingDescription is to provide a way of, how to render an LDR representation from a certain HDR image in different applications to appear similar. Such a description should be included into a ICC style colour profile. As one step a OpenIccForGoogleSoC2007 project was underway.

== General Topics ==
=== Directory scheme for Colour Management ===
[[http://www.oyranos.com/wiki/index.php?title=OpenIccDirectoryProposal|OpenICC Directory Proposal]]

=== net-color spec ===
[[http://www.oyranos.org/scm?p=xcolor.git;a=blob;f=docs/net-color-spec;h=e27ff95b4|Version 0.2 Draft 2]] is public. The goal is to communicate ICC colour regions between server and clients. The implementation is available in libXcm-0.2.x. Some tools and plugin in the Oyranos examples directory support the draft by using libXcm.

== Requirements of Applications and Services ==
=== Link Collection ===
 *[[https://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Applications|Applications at ColourWiki]]
 *[[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/OpenIcc/Cairo|Cairo]]

=== PPD colouring ===
End user applications want to assign ICC profiles to a combination of printer device, a driver and a set of colour related driver options. Thus for PPD to support this scheme, it is necessary to know, which PPD option is colour related. The proposal suggests a enumerated list of PPD key words named !ColorKeyWords, containing a semicolon ';' separated list of PPD key words. The listed keys relate to colour and thus with their values to the ICC profile selection at application level.



= LINUX color management a proposal for implementation =

OpenIcc/LinuxCmProposal describes a roadmap for color management under LINUX with the interaction of

 * A profile repository connecting devices, documents and profiles
 * Engine for ICC color transformations of Image maps
 * Cairo
 * Ghostscript
 * monitor output
 * printer driver (e.g. Gutenprint or Turboprint)
 * CUPS / PPDs
 * File export
 * application interface

[[http://www.oyranos.org/wiki|ColourWiki]] contains [[http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Device_Settings#Printing|schemes for colour managed printing]]. They are graphical and in some parts more technical.

= Color managed Printing Path =

OpenIcc/ColorMangedPrintingPath is a proposal for coordinating developments of Gutenprint, CPD and pdftoraster moduls like e.g. GhostScript to create a reliable color managed printing path both for standard users, color enthusiasts and color professionals.

= Google SoC =

Suggestions for Googles Summer of Code 2011 are here OpenIcc/GoogleSoC2011.  Students will find our project goals and ideas, contact persons, requirements and other hints there.

Students who successfully complete their projects will receive a significant stipend from Google for their work.  Not our application is not agreed upon.
For the older projects and ideas see here OpenIcc/GoogleSoC2010, OpenIcc/GoogleSoC2009, OpenIccForGoogleSoC2008 and here OpenIccForGoogleSoC2007.
